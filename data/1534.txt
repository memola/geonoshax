LO sir, who so that looks here for courtesy
And seth me seem as one pretending none
But as unthought upon thus suddenly
Approaches the myddys among you every chone
And of you all says nought to any one.
May think me rowed perceiving of what sort
ye seem to be, and of what stately port.
But I beseech you in most humble wise
To omit displeasure and pardon me
My manner is to muse and to deuyse
So that some time my self may cary me
My self knowyth not where, and I asure ye
So hath my self done now, for our lord wot
where I am, or what ye be, I know not.
Or whence I cam, or whither I shall
All this in manner as unknown to me
But euyn as fortune guydeth my foot to fale
So wander I, yet where so ever I be
And whom o• howe many so ever I se
As one person to me is every chone
So every place to me but as one
And for that one person every place seek I
which one ones found I find of all the rest
Not one missing, and in the contrary
That one absent, though that there were here pressed
All the creatures living most and lest
yet lacking her I should and ever shall
Be as alone syns she to me is all
And alone is she without comparison
Concerning the gyftys gyuyn by nature
In favour fairness and port as of person
No life beryth the like of that creature
Nor no tongue can attain to put in ur
Her to dyscryue, for howe can words express
That thing the full whereof no thought can ges.
And as it is thing inesty mable
To make report of her beauty fully
So is my love to ward her unable
To be reportyd as who says rightly
For my soole service and love to that lady
Is given under such haboundant fashion
That no tongue thereof can make right relashyon.
wherein I suppose this well supposed
Unto you all, that syns she perceiving
As much of my love as can be disclosed
Euyn of very right in recompensing
She ought for my love again to be loving
For what more right to grant when love love requires
Then love for love, when love nought else desires
But euyn as far worse as otherwise then so
Stand I in case in manner desperate
No time can time my sewt to ease my wo
Before none to early and all times else to late
Thus time out of time mystymeth my rate
For time to bring time to hope of any grace
That time timid no time in any time or place.
whereby till time have time so far extinct
That death may determine my life thus deadly
No time can I rest alas I am so lyncte
To greues both so great and also many
That by the same I say and will verify
Of all pains the most incomparable payne
Is to be a lover not loved again.
Sir as touching those words of comparison
which ye have said and would seem to verify
If it may please you to stand thereupon
Hearing and answering me patiently
I doubt not by the same incontinently
your self to see by words that shall ensue
The contrary of your words verified for true.
Fair lady pleasyth it you to repayrenere
And in this cause to show cause reasonable
whereby cause of reformation may appear
Of reason I must and will be reformable
well syns ye pretend to be confyrmable
To reason, in avoiding circumstance
Brefely by reason I shall the truth advance.
ye be a lover no whyt loved again
And I am loved of whom I love nothing
Then stands our question between these twain
Of loving not loved, or loved not loving
which is the case most painful in suffering
where I say that the most payne doth move
To those belouyd of whom they can not love
Those words approved lo, might make a change
Of mine opinion / but verily
The case as ye put it I think more strange
Then true, for though the belouyd party
Can not love again, yet possibly
Can I not think, nor I think never shall
That to be loved can be any payne at all.
That reason perceived and received for troth
From proper comparison should clear confound me
Between payne &amp; no payne, no such comparison growth
Then or I can on comparison ground me
To prove my case painful ye have first bound me
To which syns ye drive me by your denial
Mark what ensues before farther trial.
I say I am loved of a certain man
whom for no sewt I can favour again
And that have I told him syns his sewt began
A thousand times but every time in vain
For never seizes his tongue to complain
And ever one tale which I never can flee
For ever in manner where I am is he.
Now if you to here one thing every where
Contrary to your appetite should be led
were it but a mouse lo should pepe in your ere
Or always to harp on a crust of bred
Howe could you like such harping at your head
Somewhat displeasant it were I not deny
Then somewhat painful as well said say I
Displeasure and payne be things jointly anex•
For as it is displeasant in payne to be
So it is painful in displeasure to be vexed
Thus by displeasure in payne ye confess me
whereby syns ye part of my payne do see
In my farther payne I shall now declare
That payne by which with your payne I compare.
Small were the quantyte of my painful smart
if his iangelynge pierced no further then mine erys
But thorough mine erys directly to mine heart
percyth his words euyn like as many sperys
By which I have spent so many and such terys
That were they all red as they be all white
The blood of my heart had be gone or this quyte
And almost in case as though it were gone
Am I except his sewt take end shortly
For it doth like me euyn like as one
Should offer me service most humbly
with an axe in his hand, continually
Beseeching me gentylly that this might be sped
To grant him my good will to strike of my head
I allege for general this one similitude
Avoiding rehearsal of pains particular
To abreueate the time and to exclude
Surplusage of words in this our matter
By which ensaumple if ye consider
Rightly my case at lest wise ye may see
My payne as painful as your payne can bee.
And yet for shorter end put case that your payne
were oft times more sharpe and sore in degre
Then mine is at any time yet will I prove plain
My payne at length sufficient to match ye
which prof to be true your self shall agree
if your affection in that I shall resyght
May suffer your reason to understand right
you stand in pleasure having your love in sight
And in her absence hope of sight again
Kepyth most times possession of some delight
Thus have you oft times some way ease of payne
And I never no way for when I do remain
In his presens, in deadly payne I solorne
And absent, half ded in fear of his return
Syns presens nor absence absenteth my payne
But always the same to me is present
And that by presens and hope of presens again
There doth appear much of your time spent
Out of payne, me think this consequent
That my payne may well by mean of the length
Compare with your shorter payne of more strength
Mistress if your long payne be no stronger
Then is your lunge reason against my short payne
ye lack no lycklyhod to live much longer
Then he that would strike of your head so fain
yet lest ye would note me your words to dysdayne
I am content to agree for a season
To grant and enlarge your latter reason
Omit by her presens half my time pleasant
And all your time as painful as in case can be
yet your payne to be most, reason will not grant
And for ensample I put case that ye
Stood in cold water all a day to the kne
And I half the same day to mid leg in the fire
would ye change places with me for the dryer
Nay that would I not be ye assuered
Forsooth and my payne aboue yours is as ill
As fire aboue water thus to be endewred
Came my payne but at times and yours continue styll
yet should mine many ways to whom can skill
Show yours, in comparison between the twain
Skantly able for a shadow to my payne
Felt ye but one pang such as I feel many
One pang of despair, or one pang of desire
One pang of one displeasant loke of her eye
One pang of one word of her mouth as in ire
Or in restraint of her love which I require
One pang of all these felt ones in all your life
Should quail your opinion and quench all our strife
which pangs I say admitted short as ye list
And all my time beside pleasant as ye please
yet could not the shortness the sharpness so resist
The piercing of my heart in the lest of all these
Bur much it ouermatheth all your disease
For no whyt in effect is your case displeasant
But to deny a thing which ye list not to grant
Or to here a sewter by daily petition
In humble manner as wit can deuyse
Require a thing so standing in condyshyon
As no portion of all his enterprise
without your consent can speed in any wise
This sewt thus attempted never so long
Doubt ye no death till your payne be more strong
Now syns in this matter between vs disputed
Mine admittance of your words notwithstanding
I have thus fully your part confuted
what can ye say now I come to denying
your principle, granted in my foresayeng
which was this, by the presens of my lady
I granted you half my time spent pleasantly
Although mine affection ledyth me to consent
That her selde presens is my relefe only
yet as in reason appears all my torment
Bred by her presens and mark this cause why
Before I saw her I felt no malydy
And syns I saw her I never was fre
From twain the greatest pains that in love be
Desire is the first upon my first sight
And despair the next upon my first sewt
For upon her first answer hope was put to flight
And never came syns in place to dyspewt
Howe brings then her presens to me any frewt
For hopeless and helpless in flames of desire
And drops of despair I smolder in fire
These twain being endeles syns they began
And both by the presens of her wholly
Begone and continued, I wonder if ye can
Speak any word more, but yield ymmedyately
For had I no mo pains but these, yet clearly
A thousand times more is my grefe in these twain
Then yours in all the case by which ye complain
That is as ye say but not as I suppose
Nor as the treuth is, which your self might se
By reasons that I could and would disclose
Saving that I see such parcyalyte
On your part, that we shall never agree
Unless ye will admit some man indifferent
Indifferently to hear vs, and so give judgment.
Agreed, For though the knowledge of all my payne
Ease my payne no whyt yet shall it declare
Great cause of abashement in you to complain
In counterfeit pains with my payne to compare
But here is no judge mete, we must seek else where
I hold me content the same to condescend
Please it you to set forth and I shall attend.
By come experience who can deny
Inpossibylyte for man to show
His inward intent, but by signs outwardly
As writing, speech, or countenaūce, whereby doth grow
Outward perceiving inwardly to know
Of every secrecy in mans breast wrought
Fro man unto man the effect of eche thought
These things well weyd in many things show need
In our outward signs to show vs so that plain
According to our thoughts / words and signs proceed
For in outward signs where men are scene to fain
what credence in man to man may remain
Mans inward mind with outward signs to fable
May soon be more come than cōmendable.
Much are we lovers then to be commendyd
For love his appearance dyssembleth in no wise
But as the heart felyth like signs always pretendyd
who fain in appearance are loves mortal enemies
As in despair of speed who that can mirth deuyse
Or having grant of grace can show them as morners
Such be no lovers but euyn very skorners.
The true lovers heart that can not obtain
Is so tormentyd that all the body
Is evermore so compelde to complain
That sooner may the sufferer hyde the fury
Of a fervent fever, then of that malady
By any power human he possible may
Hyde the lest payne of a thousand I dare say.
And he who in loving hath lot to such luck.
That love for love of his love be found
Shall be of power euyn as easily to pluck
The moan in a momet with a finger to ground
As of his joy to enclose the rebound
But that the refleccion thereof from his heart
To his beholders shall shyne in eche part
Thus be a lover in joy or in care
All though will and wit his estate would hyde
yet shall his semblance as a dial declare
Howe the clock goes which may be well applied
In abrygement of circumstaūce for a guyed
To lead you in few words by my byhauour
To know me in grace of my ladies favour.
For being a lover as I am in dede
And thereto dysposyd thus pleasantly
Is a plain appearance of my such speed
As I in love cowld wysh and undoubtedly
My love is requited so lovingly
That in every thing that may delight my mind.
My wit can not wish it so well as I find
which thing at full consydred, I suppose
That all the whole world must agree in one voice
I being beloved as I now disclose
Of one being chief of all the hole choice
Must have incomparable cause to rejoice
For the highest pleasure that man may obtain
Is to be a lover beloved again
Now god you good euyn master woodcock
Comes of rudeness or lewdness that mock
Come whereof it shall ye come of such stock
That god you good euyn master woodcock.
This losel by like hath lost his wit
Nay nay master woodcock not a whyt
I have known you for a woodcock or this
Or else like a woodcock I take you a my▪
But though for a woodcock ye deny the same
yet shall your wit witness you mete for that name.
Howe so?
Thus lo.
I do perceive by your former process.
That ye be a lover where ye confess
your self beloved in as loving wise
As by wit and will ye can wish to deuyse
C•ncludyng therein determinately
That of all pleasures pleasant to the body
The highest pleasure that man may obtain
Is to be a lover beloved again
In which conclusion before all this flock
I shall prove you plain as wise as a woodcock
And me think this woodcock is tornd on thy side
Contrary to curtsy and reason to use
Thus rudely to rail or any word be tried
In prof of thy part, whereby I do refuse
To answer the same, thou can not excuse
Thy folly in this, but if thou will say ought
Assay to say better for this saying is nought
well syns it is so that ye be discontent
To be called foal or further matter be spent
will ye give me leave to call ye foal anon
when your self perceives that I have proved you one.
ye by my soul and will take it in good worth
Now by my fathers soul then will we euyn forth
That part rehearsed of your saying or this
Of all our debate the only cause is
For where ye before have fastly affirmed
That such as be lovers again beloved
Stand in most pleasure that to man may move
That tale to be false truth shall truly prove
what folk aboue those live more pleasantly
what folk mary euyn such folk as am I
Being no lover what man may ye be
No lover no by god I warrant ye
I am no lover in such manner meant
As doth appear in this purpose present
For as touchyug women go where I shall
I am at one point with women all.
The smothest the •myrkest the smallest
Thetrewest / the trymest / the tallest / 
The wisest / the wiliest / the wildest / 
The m•ryest / the manerlyest / the mildest /

So god be my help I love never one.
Then I beseech the this one thing tell me
Howe many women think thou doth love the
Sir as I be saved by ought I can prove
I am beloved euyn like as I love
Then as appears by those words rehearsed
Thou art another lover nor beloved
Norther lover nor beloved that is even true
Syns that is true I marvel what can ensue
For prof of thy part in that thou made avaunt
Of both our estates to prove thine most pleasant
My part for most pleasant may soon be gest
By my continual quyetyd rest
Being no lover who may quiet be▪
Nay being a lover what man is he
That is quiet
Mary I
Mary ye lye
what pacyens my friend ye are to hasty
If ye will patiently mark what I shall say
your self shall perceive me in quiet always
Say what thou will and I therein protest
To believe no word thou say most nor lest
Than we twain shall talk both in vain I see
Except our matter awarded may be
By judgment of some indifferent herer
Mary go thou and be an inquirer
And if thou can bring one any thing lyckly
He shall be admitted for my part quickly
Now by the good god I grant to agree
For be thou assewred it scorns me
That thou should compare in pleasure to be
Like me, and surely I promise the
One way or other I will find redress
Find the best and next way thy wit can ges
And except your nobs for malous do need ye
Make brefe return a felyshyp speed ye.
My marvel is no more then my care is small
what knave this fool shall bring being not partial
And yet be he false and afolyshe knave to
So that it be not to much a do
To bring a daw to here and speak right
I force for no man the worth of a myte
And syns my doubt is so small in good speed
what should my study be more then my need
Till time I perceive this woodcock coming
My part hereof should pas euyn in mummyng
Saving for pastime syns I consider
He being a lover and all his matter
To depend on love and contrary I
No lover, by which all such standing by
As favour my part, may fear me to weyke
Against the loving of this lover to speyke
I shall for your confort declare such a story
As shall perfectly plant in your memory
That I have knowledge in lovers laws
As deep as some dosyn of those dotyng daws
which told all ye whose fancies stick ne'er me
Shall know it causeles in this case to fear me
For though as I show I am no lover now
Nor never have ben yet shall I show you
Now that I ones chanced to take in hand
To fain my self a lover ye shall understand
Toward such a sweating as by sweet sent savour
I know not the like in fashion and favour
And to begin
At setting in
First was her skin
Whyt smooth &amp; thyn
And every vain
So blew scene plain
Her golden hear
To see her wear
Her weryng ger
Alas I fere
To tell all to you
I shall undo you
Her eye so rolling
Each hart cōtrollyng
Her nose not long
Nor stood not wrong
Her finger tips
So clean she clyps
Her rosy lips
Her chekes gossips
So fair so ruddy
It axes study
The hole to tell
It did excel
It was so made
That euyn the shade
At every glade
would hearts invade
The paps so small
And round with all
The wast not myckyll
But it was tyckyll
The thigh the kne
As they should be
But such a leg
A lover would beg
To set eye on
But it is gon
Then sight of the foot
Rift hearts to the rote
And last of all sent katheryns whele
was never so round, as was her heal
Asawt her heart and who could win it
As for her heal no hold in it
yet over that her beauty was so much
In pleasant qualytes her graces were such
For dalyaunt pastaunce pas where she should
No greater difference between led and gold
Then between the rest and her, and such a wit
That no wight I wene might match her in it
If she had not wit to set wise men to scole
Then shall my tale prove me a stark foal
But in this matter to make you mete to ges
ye shall understand that I with this mistress
Fill late acquainted and for love no whyt
But for my pleasure to approve my wit
Now I could love to this trycker dyssymble
who in dyssymelyng was perfect and nimble
For where or when she list to give a mock
She could and would do it beyond the neck
wherein I thought that if I trysed her
I should thereby like my wit the better
And if she chanced to trip or tryse me
It should to learn wit a good lesson be
Thus for my past time I did determine
To mock or be mocked of this mocking vermin
For which her presens I did first obtain
And that obtained forth with fell we twain
In great acquaintance and made as good chere
As we had ben acquainted twenty year
And I through fair flattering behauour
Seemed anon so deep in her favour
That though the time then so far passed was
That time required vs asonder to pas
yet could I no passport get of my sweating
Till I was full wood for the next days meting
For sewrauns whereof I must as she bad
Give her in gage best jewel I there had
And after much mirth as our wits could deuyse
we parted and I the next morn did arise
In time not to timely such time as I could
I allow no love where sleep is not aloud
I was or I entered this journey vowed
Decked very cleanly but not very proud
But trym must I be, for slovenly lobers
Have ye wot well no place among lovers
But I thus decked at all points point deuyce
At door were this trull was I was at a tryce
whereat I knocked her presens to wyn
wherewith it was opened and I was let in
And at my first coming my minion seemed
Very merry, but anon she mysdemed
That I was not merrily disposed
And so might she think, for I disclosed
No word nor loke, but such as showed as sadly
As I in dede inwardly thought madly
And so must I show for lovers be in rate
Sometimes merry but most times passionate
In giving thanks to her of over night
we set vs down an heavy couple in sight
And therewithal I fet a sigh such one
As made the form shake which we both sat on
whereupon she without more words spoken
Fell in weeping as her heart should have broken
And I in secret laughing so heartily
That from mine eyes cam water plenteously
Anon I turned with loke sadly that she
My weeping as watery as hers might se
which done these words anon to me she spake
Alas dere heart what wight might undertake
To she we one so sad as you this morning
Being so merry as you last evening
I so far then the merrier for you
And without desert thus far the sadder now.
The self thing quoth I which made me then glad
The self same is thing that makes me now sad
The love that I owe you is original
Ground of my late toy and present payne all
And by this mean, love is evermore lad
Between two angels one good and one bad
Hope and dread which two be always at strife
which one of them both with love shall roll most rife
And hope that good angel first part of last night
Draw dread that bad angel out of place quite
Hope swear I should straight have your love at ones
And dread this bad angel swear blood and bones
That if I wan your love all in one hour
I should lose it all again in three or four
wherein this good angel hath lost the mastry
And I by this bad angel won this agony
And be ye sewer I stand now in such case
That if I lack your continued grace
In heuyn / hell / or yerth / there is not that he
Save only god that knows what shall come on me
I love not in rate all the common flock
I am no fainer nor I can not mock
wherefore I beseech you that your reward
May witness that ye do my truth regard
Sir as touching mocking quoth she I am sewer
ye be to wise to put that here in ur
For another give I cause why ye so should do
Nor nought could ye win that way wurth an old shoe
For who so that mocks shall surely stir
This old proverb mockum moccabitur
But as for you I think my self assewred
That very love hath you hither alewred
For which quoth she let hope hop up again
And vaynquysh dred so that it be in vain
To dred or to doubt but I in every thing
As cause gives cause will be your own darling
Sweet heart quoth I after stormy cold smarts
warm words i warm lovers bring lovers warm hearts
And so have your words warmed my heart euyn now
That dredles and doubtless now must I love you
Anon there was I love you and I love you
Lovely we lovers love eche other
I love you and I for love love you
My lovely loving loved brother
Love me, love the, love we, love he, love she,
Depper love apparent in no twain can be
Duyte over the ears in love and felt no ground
Had not swimming help in love I had bin dround
But I swam by the shore the bauntage to keep
To mock her in love se•yng to swim more deep
Thus contynull we day by day

And I to show my self in like loving
Dyssimyled like chere in all herlyke looking
By this and other like things then in hand
I gane her •••kes me thought aboue a thousand
whereby I thought her own tale like a bur
Stack to her own back mockum moccabitur
And upon this I felt in devising
To bring to end this idol dysgysyng
whereupon suddenly I stale away
And when I had •en absent half a day
My heart mysgaue me by god that bought me
That if she mist me where I thought she sought me

To my self I laughed euyn heartily
with my self considering to have had like speed
If my self had ben a lover in dede.
But now to make some matter whereby
I may take my leave of my love honestly
Sweet hart quoth I ye take to much upon ye
No more then becomes me know thou well quoth she
But thou hast takyn to much upon the
In taking that thou toke in hand to mock me
wherein from beginning I have scene the jet
Like as a fool might have iettyd in a net
Beleuyng himself save of him self only
To be perceived of no living body
But well saw I thine intent at beginning
was to bestow a mock on me at ending
when thou laughedest dyssymulyng a weeping hare
Then I with weeping eyes played euyn the like part
wherewith I brought in moccum moccabitur
And yet thou being a long snouted cur
Could no whyt smell that all my meaning was
To give mock for mock as now is come to pas
which now thus passed if thy wit be handsome
May defend the from mocks in time to come
By clappyng fast to thy snout every day
Mo•rum moccabitur for a nosegay
whetwith shestart up and shit her window to
which done I had no more to say nor do
But think my self or any man else a fool
In mocks or wiles to set women to scoole
But now to purpose wherefore I began
All though I were made a foal by this woman
Concerning mocking yet doth this tale approve
That I am well scene in the art of love
For I intending no love but to mock
yet could no lover of all the hole flock
Ctrcumstaunce of love disclose more nor better
Then did I the substance being no greater
And by this tale before ye all may see
All though a lover as well loved be
As love can deuyse him for pleasant speed
yet two dyspleasures telousy and dread
Is mixed with love whereby love is a drink mete
To give babes for worms for it drinks bitter sweet
And as for this babe our lover in whose head
By a frantic worm his opinion is bred
After one draught of this medsyn mynystryd
In to his brain by my brain apoyntyd
Reason shall so temper his opinion
That he shall see it not worth an onion
And if he have any other thing to ley
I have to convince him every way
And syns my part now doth thus well appear
Be ye my parteners now all of good chere
But silence every man upon a payne
For master woodcock is now come again.
The old saying says he that seeks shall find
which after long sekyng true have I found
But for such a finding my self to bind
To such a sekyng as I was now bound
I would rather seek to less twenty punt
Howe be it I have sought so far to my payne
That at the last I have found and brought twain
Come they a horse back
Nay they come a foot
which thou might see here, but for this great mist
By eyes and yet see I thou blind bald cote
That one of those twain might ride if he list
How?
Mary for he ledyth a nag on his his fist
Mistress ye are welcome, and welcome ye be
Nay welcome be ye, for we were here before ye
ye have ben here before me before now
And now I am here before you
And now I am here behind ye
And no we ye be here behind me
And now we be here euyn both to gether
And now be we welcome euyn both hither
Syns now ye find me here with curtsy I may
Bid you welcome hither as I may say
But setting this aside, let vs set a brooch
The matter wherefore ye hither approach
wherein I have hope that ye both will be
Good unto me, and especially ye
For I have a mind that every good face
Hath ever some pity of a pore mans case
Being as mine is a matter so right
That a foal may judge it right at first sight
Sir ye may well doubt howe my wit will serve
But my will from right shall never swerve
Nor mine, and as ye sew for help to me
Like sewt have I to sew for help to ye
For as much need have I of help as you
I think well that dere hart but tell me how
The case is this, ye twain seem in pleasure
And we twain in payne which payne doth procure
By comparison between him and me
As great a conflict which of vs twain be
In greatest payne, as is between ye twain
which of you twain in most pleasure doth remain
wherein we somewhat have here debated
And both to tell truth so gredyly grated
Upon affection eche to our own side
That in conclusion we must needs provide
Some such as would and could be indifferent
And we both to stand unto that judgment
whereupon for lack of a judge in this place
we sought many places and yet in this case
No man could we mete that medyll will or can
Till time that we met with this gentleman
whom in like errand for like lack of aid
was driven to desire our judgment he said
Forsooth it is so I promising plain
They twain between vs twain giving iudgemēt plain
we twain between them twain should judge right again
That promise to perform I not dysdayne
For touching right as I am a righteous man
I will give you as much right as I can
Nothing but right desire I you among
I willingly will another give nor take wrong
Nay in my conscience I think by this book
your conscience will take nothing that comes a croak
For as in conscience what ever ye do
ye nothing do but as ye would be done to
O hope of good end, o Mary mother
Mistress one of vs may now help a another
But sir I pray you some matter declare
whereby I may know in what grefe ye are
I am a lover not loved which plain
Is daily not doleful but my deadly payne
A lover not loved have ye knit that knot
ye forsooth
Forsooth ye be the more sot
Now mistress I heartily beseech ye
Tell me what manner case your case may be
I am beloved not loving whereby
I am not in payne but in tormentry
Is this your tormentor god turn him to good
Nay there is another man one me as wood
As this man on a another woman is
ye think them both mad and so do I by eyes
So mot I thryue but who that list to mark
shall perceive here a pretty peyce of work
Let vs fall somewhat in these parts to ska•nyng
Loving not loved, loved not loving
Loved and loving, not loving nor loved
will ye see these four parts well joined
Loving not loved, and loved not loving
Those parts can join in no manner rekenyng
Loving and loved, loved nor lover
These parts in joining in likewise differ
But in that ye love ye twain joined be
And being not loved ye join with me
And being no lover with me joins she
And being beloved with her join ye
Had I a joiner with me joined jointly
we ioyners should join joint to joint quickly
For first I would part these parts in fleses
And ones departed these parted peses
Part and part with part I would so partlyke part
That eche part should part with quiet heart
Sir syns it passes your power that part to play
Let pass, and let vs partly now assay
To bring some part of that purpose to end
For which all parties yet in vain attend
I do desire the same and that we twain
May first be harde that I may know my payne
I grant for my part by faith of my body
why where the devil is this horizon noddy
I never sit in justice but ever more
I use to be shryuen a little before
And now syns that my confession is done
I will depart and come take penance soon
when cōscyens prycketh conscience must be searched by god
In discharging of conscience or else gods forbod
which makes me mete when conscyēs must come in place
To be a judge in every come case
But who may like me his auaunsement avaunt
Now am I a judge and never was seriaunt
which ye regard not much by ought that I see
By any reverence that ye do to me
Nay yet I praise women when great men go by
They crouch to the ground loke here how they lie
They shall have a beck by saint Antony
But alas good mistress I cry you mercy
That you are unanswered but ye may see
Though two tales at ones by two ears hard may be
yet can not one mouth two tales at ones answer
which makes you tarry but in your matter
Syns ye by hast in having ferdest home
would first be sped of that for which ye come
I grant as he granted your will to fulfil
you twain to be harde first, begin when you will
As these twain vs twain now grant first to break
Syns twain to be harde, at ones can not speak
I now desire your grant, that I may open
First tale which now is at point to be spoken
which I crave no whyt my part to advance
But with the pyth to avoid circumstance
Speak what and when so ever it please you
Till reason will me, I will not disease you
Sirs other here is a very weyke brain
Or she hath if any a very weyke payne
For I put case that my love I her gave
And that for my love, her love I did crave
For which though I daily sew day by day
what loss or payne to her if she say nay
yes by saint Mary so the case may stand
That some woman had lever take in hand
To ride on your errand on hundredth mile
Then to say nay one Pater noster while
If ye on her part any payne define
which is the more painful her payne or mine
your payne is most if she say nay and take it
But if that she say nay and forsake it
Then is her payne a great way the greater
Sir ye allege this nay in this matter
As though my denial my sewter to love
where all or the most payne that to me doth move
wherein the treuth is a contrary plain
For though to oft speaking one thing be a payne
yet is that one word the full of my hoping
To bring his hoping to despair at ending
Thus is this nay which ye take my most grefe
Though it be painful yet my most relefe
But my most payne is all an other thing
which though ye forget or hyde by dyssymylyng
I partly showed you, but all I could nor can
But masters to you with payne of this man
That payne that I compare is partly this
I am loved of one whom the treuth is
I can not love, and so it is with me
That from him in manner I never can •l••
And every one word in sewt of his part
Nips through mine ears and rons through my heart
His gastfull loke so pale that vnneth I
Dare for mine ears cast toward him an eye
And when I do that eye my thought presentyth
Straight to my hart and thus my payne augmentyth
One tale so oft alas and so importune
His exclamacions sometime on fortune
Some time on himself some time upon me
And for that thing that if my death should be
Brought straight in place except I were content
To grant the same, yet could I not assent
And he saying this yet seasyth not to crave
what death could be worse then this life that I have
This tale to purpose purporteth no more
But sight and hearing complaint of his sore
Is only the grefe that ye do sustain
Alas tender hart syns ye dye in payne
This payue to perceive by sight and hearing
Howe could you live to know our payne by feeling
Mark well this question and answer as ye can
A man that is hanged or that mans hangman
which man of those twain suffered most payne
He that is hanged
By the mass it is so plain
well said for me, for I am the sufferer
And ye the hangman understand as it were
These cases vary in no manner a thing
Saving this serves in this man hanging
Commonly is done against the hangmans will
And ye of delightful will, your lover kill
Of delightful will, nay that is not so
As ye shall perfectly perceive or we go
But of those at whose hanging have hangmen by
Howe many have ye known hang willingly
Nay ueuer one in his life bier lady
In this lo your case from our case doth vary
For ye that love where love will take no place
your own will is your own leder a plain case
And not only uncompelled without alewre
But fore against her will your sewt ye endewre
Now syns your will to love did you procure
And with that will, ye put that love in v•e
And now that will, by wit seth love such payne
As witty will would will love to refrain
And ye by will that love in eche condition
To extinct, may be your own phesicion
Except ye be a fool or would make me one
what saying cowed set a good ground to sit on
To make any man think your payne thus strong
Making your own salve your own sore thus long
Mistress much part of this process purposed
Is matter of truth truly disclosed
My will without her will brought me in love
which will without her will doth make me hove
Upon her grace to see what grace will prove
But where ye say my will may me remove
As well from her love, as will brought me to it
That is false my will can not will to do it
My will as far therein out weyth my power
As a sow of led out weyth a saforne flower
your will out weyth your power thē where is your wit
I marvel that ever ye will speak it
Nay marvel ye mistress thereat no whyt
For as far as this point may stretch in verdict
I am clearly of this mans opinion
And I contrary with this minion
Then be we come to a demurrer in law
Then be ye come from a woodcock to a daw
And by god it is no small conning brother
For me to turn one wild fool to a another
Nay masters I heartily pray you both
Banish contention till ye see howe this goth
I will repeat and answer her tale forth with
The pyth for your part whereof pretendyth
A prof for your payne to be more then mine
In that my will not only did me incline
To the same, but in the same by the same will
I willingly will to continue styll
And as will brought me and kepeth in this bay
when I will ye say, will will bring me away
Concluding thereby that if my payne were
As great as yours that I should suerly bear
As great and good will to flee my love thus meant
As do ye your sewters presens to absent
This tale shows my tale perceived every dell
Then for entry to answer it as well
Answer this put case ye as deeply now▪
Did love your lover as he doth love you
Should not that loving suppose ye redress
That payne which lack of loving doth posses
yes
Syns love gyuyn to him gives your self ease, than
Except ye love payne, why love ye not this man
Love him nay as I said must I straight chose
To love him or else my head here to lose
I know well I could not my life to save
with loving will grant him my love to have
I think ye speak truly for will will not be
Forced in love wherefore the same to ye
Syns this is to you such difficult
why not a thing as difficult to me
To will the let of love where will my love hath set
As you to will to set love where will is your let
well said and put case it as harde now be
For you to will to leave her, as for me
To love him, yet have ye aboue me a mean
To learn you at length to will to leave love clean
which mean many thousands of lovers hath brought
From right fervent loving to love right nought
which long and oft approved mean is absence
where when ye will ye may have license
which I crave and wish and can not obtain
For he will never my presens refrain
This is a medsyn like as ye would will me
For thing to kewre me the thing that would kill me
For presens of her, though I selde when may have
Is fool the medsyn that my life doth save
Her absence can I with as ill will will
As I can will to let to love her styll
Thus is this will brought in insydently
No aid in your purpose worth tail of a fly
And as concerning our principal matter
All that ye lay may be laid euyn a water
I wonder that shame suffered you to compare
with my payne, syns ye are driven to declare
That all your payne is but sight and hearing
Of him that as I do dies in payne feeling
O payne upon payne what pains I sustain
No craft of the devil can express all my payne
In this body no lym / joint / senow / nor vein / 
But martreth eche other, and this brain
Chief enemy of all by the inventing
Mine unsavoury sewte to her discontenting
My speaking, my hearing, my looking, my thinking
In syttyng, in standing, in waking, or winking,
what ever I do, or where ever I go
My brain and mishap in all these do me wo
As for my senses eche one of all five
wondered as it can to feel it self a live
And than hath love gotten all in one bed
Him self and his servants to lodge in this head
Vain hope, despair, dread, and audacity,
Hast, wast, lust without liking or liberty
Diligence, humilyte, trust, and jealousy,
Desire, patient sufferance, and constancy,
These with other in this head like swarms of bees
Sting in debating their contraryetees
The venom whereof from this head dystylleth
Down to this breast and this hart it kills
All times in all places of this body
By this dystemperaunce thus dystempored am I
Shivering in cold and yet in hete I dye
Drowned in moisture parched parchment dry
Cold hot most dry all in all places at ones
Mary sir this is an agew for the nones
But or we give judgment I must search to view
whether this euydens be false or true
Nay stand styll your part shall prove never the wars
Foe by saint savour here is a what ars
Let me feel your nose, nay fere not man be bold
well though this ars be warm and this nose cold
yet these twain by attorney brought in one place
Are as he says cold and what both in like case
O what payne drought is see how his dry lips
Smoke for more moister of his warm moist hyps
Breath out. these eyes are dull but this nose is quicker
Here is most moister, your breath smells of lycker
well syns ye have opened in this tale telling
The full of your payne for speed to ending
I shall in few words such one question disclose
As if your answer give cause to suppose
The hole of the same to be answered at full
we need no judgment for yield my self I wu••
Put case this man loved a woman such one
who were in his liking the thing alone
And that his love to her were not so myckyll
But her fancy toward him were as little
And that she hyd her self so day and night
That selde time when he might come in her sight
And then put case that one to you love did bear
A woman that other so ugly were
That eche kiss of her mouth called you to gybbes fest
Or that your fancy abhorred her so at lest
That her presens were as sweet to suppose
As one should present
A torde to his nose
ye in good faith, where the case is this
That her spytfull presens absent never is
Of these two cases if chance should drive you
To chose one, which would ye choose tell troth now
what ye study
Tarry ye be to greedy
Men be not like women always ready
In good soth to tell treuth of these cases twain
which case is the wurst is to me uncertain
First case of these twain I put for your part
And by the last case apereth mine own smart
If they proceed with this first case of ours
Then is our matter undoubtedly yours
And if judgment pass with this last case in fine
Then is the matter asewredly mine
Syns by these cases our parts so do seem
That which is most painful your self can not deem.
If ye now will all circumstance eschew
Make this question in these cases our yssew
And the payne of these men to abreuyate
Set all our other matter as frustrate
Agreed
Then further to abridge your payne
Syns this our yssew apereth thus plain
As folk not doubting your conscience nor conning
we shall in the same let pass all reasoning
yielding to your judgment the hole of my part
And I likewise mine with will and good heart
So lo make you low curtsy to me now
And straight I will make as lowe curtsy to you
Nay stand ye ne'er the upper end I pray ye
For the neither end is good enough for me
your cases which include your grefe eche whyt
Shall dwell in this head
And in mine but yet
Or that we herein our judgment publish
I shall desire you that we twain may finish
As far in our matter toward judgment
As ye have done in yours to the intent
That we our parts brought together thither
May come to judgment fro thens to gythes
Bier lady sir and I desire the same
I would ye began
Begin then in gods name
Shall I begin
Syns I loke but for winning
Give me the end and take you the beginning
who shall win the end, the end at end shall try
For my part whereof now thus begin I
I am as I said a beloved lover
And he no lover nor beloved another
In which two cases he makes his avaunt
Of both our parts to prove his most pleasant
But be ye assuered by ought I yet se
In his estate no manner pleasure can be
yes two manner pleasures ye must needs confe•
First I have the pleasure of quietness
And the second is I am contented
That second pleasure now secondly invented
To compare with pleasure by contentashyon
Is a very second ymagynashyon
Then show your wit for prof of this in hand
Pleasure without contentation can not be
But contentation without pleasure we se
In things innumerable every day
Of all which mark these which I shall now ley
Put case that I for pleasure of some friend
Or some thing which I longed to se at end
would be content to ride three score mile this night
And never would bait nor never alight
I might be right well content to do this
And yet in this doing no pleasure there is
Moreover ye by patient sufferance
May be contented with any mischance
The loss of your child friend or any thing
That in this world to you can be longing
wherein ye contented never so well
yet is your contentation pleasure no dell
These two exsamples by ought that I se
Be no thing the things that any thing touch me
with death of my child my being contented
Or payne with my friend willingly assented
Is not contentation voluntary
For that contentation comes forcibly
But my contentation stands in such thing
As I would first wish if it went by wishing
Sir be ye contented even as ye tell
yet your contentation can another excel
Nor be compared eagle to mine estate
For touching contentation I am in rate
As hyely contented to love as ye se
As ye to forbere love can wish to be
Had I no more to say in this argument
But that I am as well as you content
yet hath my part now good approbacyon
To match with yours even by contentation
But contentation is not all the thing
That I for my love have in recompensing
Aboue contentation pleasures feeling
Have I so many, that no wight living
Can by any wit or tongue the same report
O the pleasant pleasures in our resort
After my being from her any whither
what pleasures have we in coming to gyther
Eche tap on the ground toward me with her foot
Doth bathe in delight my very heart rote
Every twynke of her aluryng eye
Reuyueth my spirits even thorowoutly
Eche word of her mouth not a preparative
But the right medicine of preservative
we be so ioconde and joyfully joined
Her love for my love so currently coined
That all pleasures yerthly the treuth to declare
Are pleasures not able with ours to compare
This mouth in manner receives no food
Love is the fedyng that doth this body good
And this head dyspyseth all these eyes winking
Longer then love doth keep this heart thinking
To dream on my sweet heart, love is my feader
Love is my lord, and love is my leader
Of all mine affairs in thought, word, and dede,
Love is the Christs cross that must be my speed
By this I perceive well ye make rekenyng
That love is a goodly and a good thing
Love good what ill in love can thou make apere
yes I shall prove this love at this time meant here
In this mans case as ill as is the devil
And in your case I shall prove love more evil
what tormentry could all the devils in hell
Deuyse to his payne that he doth not tell
what payne brings that body those devils in that head
which mini sters always by love are led
He frysyth in fire he drowns in drought
Eche part of his body love hath brought abought
where eche to help other should be diligent
They marter eche other the man to torment
without stint of rage his pains be so sore
That no fend may torment man in hell more
And as in your case to prove that love is
worse than the devil my meaning is this
Love distempers him by torment in payne
And love distempers you as far in joy plain
your own confession declares that ye
Eat, drink, or sleep euyn as little as he
And he that lacks any one of those three
Be it by joy or by payne clear ye see
Death must be sequel howe ever it be
And thus are ye both brought by loves induccyon
By payne or by joy to like point of destruction
which point aproueth love in this case past
Beyond the devil in turmentry to have a cast
For I trow ye find not that the devil can find
To turment man in hell by any pleasant mind
whereby as I said I say of love styll
Of the deayll and love, love is the more ill
And at beginning I may say to you
If god had scene as much as I say now
Love had ben Lucyfer and doubt ye no whyt
But experience now hath taught god such wit
That if ought come at Lucyfer other then good
To whip souls on the brech love shall be the blood
And sewer he is one that can not live long
For aged folk ye wot well can not be strong
And an other thing his phisicyou doth ges
That he is infect with the blak iawndes
No farther then ye be infect with folly
For in all these words no word can I espy
Such as for your part any prof avouches
For prof of my part, no but it touches
The dysprofe of yours for where you alleged
your part aboue mine to be compared
By pleasures in which your dyspleasures are such
That ye eat, drink, nor sleep, or at most not much
In lack whereof my tale proves plainly
Eche part of your pleasure a turmentry
whereby your good love I have proved so evil
That love is apparently worse then the devil
And as touching my part there can arise
No manner dyspleasures nor tormentryes
In that I love not, nor am not loved
I move no dyspleasures nor none to me moved
But all dyspleasures of love fro me absent
By absence whereof I quietly content
Sir where ye said and think ye have said well
That my joy• by love shall bring death in sequel
In that by the same in manner I dysdayne
Foot and sleep, this proverb answers you plain
Loke not on the meat, but loke on the man
Now loke ye on me and say what ye can
Nay for a time love may puff up a thing
But lacking foot and sleep death is the ending
well sir till such time as death approve it
This part of your tale may sleep every whyt
And where ye by absent displeasure would
Match with my present pleasure ye seem more bold
Then wise, for those twain be far dyfferent sewer
Is not absence of displeasure a pleasure
yes in like rate as a post is pleased
which as by no mean it can be diseased
By displeasure present so is it true
That no pleasure present in it can ensew
Pleasures or dyspleasures feeling sensibly
A post ye know well can not feel possibly
And as a post in this case I take you
Concerning the effect of pleasure in hand now
For any feeling ye in pleasu•e endure
More then ye say ye feel in displeasure
Sir though the effect of your pleasure present
Be more pleasant then displeasure absent
yet howe compare ye with mine absent payne
By present dyspleasures in which ye remain
My present dyspleasures I know none such
Know ye no payne by love little nor much
No.
Then shall I show such a thing in this purse
As shortly shall show herein your part the worse
Now I pray god the devil in hell blind me
By the mass I have left my book behind me
I beseech our lord I never go hens
If I would not rather have spent forty pens
But syns it is thus I must go fetch it
I will not tarry, a sir the devil stretch it
Farewell dawcock
Farewell woodcock
He is gone
Gone ye but he will come again anon
Nay this night he will no more dyssease you
Give judgment hardly even when it please you
which done sith he is gone my self straight shall
Ryghtously between you give judgment final
But lord what a face this foal hath set here
Till shame defaced his folly so clear
That shame hath shamfully in sight of you all
with shame driven him hens to his shameful fall
wherein all though I nought gain by winning
That ought may augment my pleasure in loving
yet shall I wyn thereby a pleasure to see
That ye all shall see the matter pas with me
what though the profit may lightly be lodyn
It grieves a man to be over trodyn
Nay when I saw that his winning must grow
By payne pretending in my part to show
Then wit I well the noddy must cum
To do as he did or stand and play mum
No man / no woman / no child in this place
But I durst for judgment trust in this case
All doubt of my payne by his prof by any mean
His ronnyng away hath now scrapped out clean
werfore give judgment and I shall return
In place hereby where my dere hart doth soiurne
And after salutation between vs had
Such as is mete to make lovers hearts glade
I shall to rejoice her in merry tidings
Declare the hole rabble of this fools lesynges
water and fire
Nay water for fire I mean
well thanked be god it is out now clean
Howe cam it there
Sir as I was going
To fet my book for which was my departing
There chanced in my way a house hereby
To fire which is burned piteously
But marvelously the people do moan
For a woman they say a goodly one
A ••ioner who•e in this house burned is
And shoe•tyng of the people for help in this
Made me ••••• thither to have done some good
And at a window thereof as I stood
I thrust in my head and euyn at a flush
Fire •lashed in my face and so toke my bush
what house?
A house painted with red oker
The owner whereof they say is a broker
Then brek hart alas why live I this day
My dere heart is dystroyd life and wealth away
what man sit down and be of good chere
Gods body master▪ woodcock is gone clear
O master woodcock fair mot be fall ye
Of right master woodcock I must now call ye
Mistress stand you here before and rub him
And I will stand here behind and dubbe him
Nay the child is a stepe ye need not rock
Master woodcock master wood wood woodcock
where folk be far within a man must knock
Is not this a pang trow ye beyond the neck
Speak master woodcock, speak parrot I pray ye
My lemon your lady ey will ye see
My lady your lemon one vntertakes
To be safe from fyreby styppyng through a takes
That word I harde but yet I see her not
No more do I master woodcock our lord wot
Ʋnto that house where I did see her last
I will seek to see her and if she be past
So that to apere there I can not make her
Then will I burn after and overtake her
well ye may burn to gyther for all this
And do well enough for ought that is yet amiss
For gods fake one run after and bast him
It were great pity the fire should wast him
For being fat your knowledge must record
A woodcock well roast is a dyshe for a lord
And for a woodcock ye all must now know him
By matter of record that so doth show him
And bravely to bring you all out of dowt
All this have I feigned to bring about
•ym self to convince him self even by act
Is he hath done here in doing this fact
He takes more thought for this one woman now
Then could I for all in the world I ma•• •••we
which hath so shamefully defaced his part
That to return another hath he face nor heart
which fene, while he and she less time in kissing
Give ye with me judgment a gods blessing
The prof of my saying at my first entry
That wretch brings now in place in that I laid
Dissembling mans mind by appearance to be
Thing meanuenyent, which thing as I said
Is proved now true, howe was I dismayed
By his false facing the death of my darling
whom I thank god is in health and eyleth nothing
Syn I beseech you of all your dismaying
what other cause can ye ley then your loving
My loving nay all the cause was your lying
what had my lye done if ye had not loved
what did my love till your lye was moved
By these two questions it seems we may make
your love and my lye to part evenly the stake
Loving and lying have we brought now hither
Lovers and liars to ley both to gyther
But put case my lye of her death were true
what excuse for your love could then ensue
If fortune god save her did bring her to it
The fault were in fortune and in love no whyt
The hole fault in fortune by my shes well yt
God send your fortune better then your wit
well sir at extremyte I can prove
The fault in fortune as much as in love
Then fortune in like case with love now join you
As I with loving joined lying even now
And well they may join all by ought that I se
For eche of all three I take like vanyte
But syns ye confess that your part of such payne
Comes half by love, and that it is certain
That certain pains to loved lovers do move
In which the fault in nothing save only love
As dred and jealousy eche of which with mo
To your estate of love is a daily foe
And I clear out of love declaring such show
As in my case no payne to me can grow
I say this consydred hath pyth sufficient
In prof of my part to drive you to judgment
Nay first a few words, sy• though I confess
That love brings some payue and your case paynses
By mean of your contented ••yetnes
Yet rha•t•ail pleasures that I posses
Are as far aboue the case that ye profes
As is my payne in your 〈…〉
Ʋnder the pleasures of 〈…〉
Thus wade how ye will one way or ot•er
If ye win one way ye shall lefe another
But if ye mi•nde for end to be brefe
Ieine with me herein for indifferent prefe
A tree ye know well is a thing that hath life
And such a thing as never feseth payne or strife
But ever quiet and always contented
And as there can no way be muented
To bring a tree displeasure by felinge pain
So no fe••nge pleasure in it can remain
A h••s is a thing that hath life also
And he •y felinge felith both wealth and wo
By driving or drawing al day in the m••er
Many painful iorneys hath be in hier
But after al those he hath always at night
These pleasures following to his great delight
First fair washed at a river or a weir
And straight br•ught to a ••abel warm and fair
Dry rubied and chafed from head to he•e
And torrid till he be flyke as an eel
Then he is litt••d in manner no•• •••
And hey as much as well in his belie
Then provender hath he o••s pese benes or breed
which feding infelinge as pleasant to his heed
As to a covetous man to behold
Of his owue westminster hall full of gold
After which feding he flepeth in quiet rest
Dewring such time as his meat may digest
Al this considred a horse or a tree
If ye must those the toue which would ye be
when the horse must to labour by our lady
I had lever be a tree then a horse I.
But ho•e when he refreth and fylleth his gorge
Then would I be a horse and no tree by saint George
But what if he must needs •••ke to the tone
which were then best by the mass I can name none
The first case is yours and the next is for me
In case like a tree I may liken ye
For as a tree hath life within feeling
whereby it felith pleasing not displeasing
And can not be but contented quietly
Even the like case is yours now presently
And as the horse feleth pain and not the tree
Like wise I have pain and no pain have ye
And as a horse aboue a tree felyth pleasure
So feel I pleasure aboue you in rate sure
And as the tree felith another and the horse both
Even so pleasure and pain between vs twain goes
Sins these two cases so indifferently fall
That your self can judge another for partial
For indifferent end I think this way best
Of all our reasoning to debar the rest
And in these two cases this one question
To be the issue that we shall join on
Be it so
Now are these issues couched so no
That both sides I trust shall take end shortly
I hope and desire the same and syns we
were first harde, we both humbly beseech ye
That we in like wise may have judgment furs•
I grant
By the mass and I come best or wurst
Though nature force man stiff•y to incline
To his own part in each particular thing!
yet reason would man when man shall determine
Other men's parts by indifferent awarding
Indifferent to be in al his reasoning
wherefore in this part cut out of office•ion
So that indifference be direc•ion
Contented with that and by ought I espy
we may in this matter take end quickly
Stan we their cases as she did apply them
That we may perceive what is meant by them
He loves unloved a goodly one
She is loved not loving of an ugly one
Or in his eye his lover seems goodly
And in her eye her lober seems as ugly
Her most desired angels face he can not see
His most lothely hell hounds face she can not flee
He loves, she abhors whereby presens is
His life, her death▪ whereby I say even this
Be his feeling pains in every degre
As great and as many as he saith they be
yet in my judgment by these cases hath she
As great and as many feeling pains as he
When matter at full is indifferently laid
As ye in this iugement have laid this now
what reason the time by me should be delayed
ye have spoken my thought wherefore to you
In poising your pains my conscience doth allow
A just counterpa•se and thus your pains be
A judged by vs twain one pain in degre
Well sins your conscience drives you thus to judge
I receive this judgment without grefe or grudge
And I in like rate, yielding unto you twain
Hearty thanks for this your undeserved pain
Now masters may it please you to declare
As touching their parts of what mind ye are
With right good will sir, and sure I suppose
Their parts in few words mate come to point well
The two examples which he did disclose
All errors or doubts do clearly expel
The estate of a tree his estate doth tell
And of the horse his tale well understand
Declares as well his case now in hand
For as nothing can please or displease a tree
By any pleasure or displeasue feeling
Nor never bring a tree discontent to be
So like case to him not loved nor loving
Love can no way bring pleasing or displeasing
Live women, die women, •ink women, or swim,
In all he content, for al is one to him
And as a horse hath mani painful •orneis
A lover best loved hath pains in like wise
As here hath appeared by sundry ways
which shows his case in wurst part to rise
But then as the horse feleth pleasure in sis
At night in the stable aboue the tree
So feleth he some pleasure as far aboue ye
In some case he feleth much more pleasure then he
And in some case he feleth even as muchelesse
Between the more and the less it seems to me
That between their pleasures no choice is to guess
Wherefore I give judgment in short process
Set the tone pleasure euiu to the tother
Womanly spoken masters by the roods mother
Who hears this tale with in different mind
And sees of these twain eche one so full bent
To his own part that another in heart can find
To change pleasures with other must needs assent
That she in these words hath given right judgment
In affirmance whereof I judge and award
Both these pleasures of yours as one in regard
well syns I think ye both without corrupcion
I shall move no matter of interruption
Nor I but masters though I say nought in this
May I not think my pleasure more than his
Affection unbridled may make vs al think
That eche of vs hath done other wrong
But where reason takes place it can not sink
Syns cause to be percial here is none vs among
That one head that would think his own wit so strong
That on his judges he might judgment devise
what judge in so judging could judge him wise
well mine estate right well contents me
And I with mine as well content as ye
So should ye both likewise be contented
Eche other to see content in such degree
As on your parts our iugement hath awarded
your neighbour in pleasure like your self to be
Gladly to wish Christ's precept doth byndeye
Thus contentation should always prefer
One man to joy the pleasure of an other
True and contention may be in like case
All though no health yet help and great relefe
In both your pains for ye having such grace
To be contented in sufferance of grefe
Shall by contentation avoid much mischief
Such as the country•y shall suerly bring you
Payne to pain as paineful as your pain is now
Thus not we four but al the world beside
Knowledge them self or other in joy or payne
Hath need of contentation for a get
Having joy or payne content let vs remain
In joy or payne of other flee we disdain
Be we content wealth or woo, and eche for other
Rejoice in the tone and pity the tother
Syns such contention may hardly acorde
In such kind of love as here hath ben meant
Let vs seek the love of that loving lord
who to suffer passion for love was content
whereby his lovers that love for love assent
Shall have in fine aboue contentation
The feeling pleasure of eternal salvation
which lord of lords whose joyful and blessed birth
Is now remembered by time presenting
This accustomyd time of honest mirth
That lord we beseech in most humble meaning
That it may please him by merciful hearing
Thestate of this audience lunge to endure
In mirth, health, and wealth, to grant his pleasure

Thy lord

For if thou be as haute / as thou begynnest
thou shalt avoid / much sonar than thou wenuyst
¶ As for mine avoidance / how soon so ever yt be
It shall not skill / as for this intent
But he that first flees / or forsakes me
He shall have greatest / occasion to repent
It shall be to his great trouble and turment
that he hath lest Reason / and suit his own folly
that thereby is fallen / to wretched penury
¶ But now as touching / the honour and degre
that I am ordained to / I will thou understand
that almighty god / of his grace and bounty
Of the and such / hath given me the over hand
And will that I use / the as a servant
to advise the and reform the / when thou gynst to err
And to clepe the homward / if thou rail to far
¶ And where thou say / thou art so necessary
that man without the / can have no living
as in that point / we shall not much vary
I wot thou art necessary / to his being
But be thou sure / that is not the very thing
That makes him / to appear so wondrous
and to be in his nature so noble and precious
¶ 〈◊◊〉 a thing that doth 〈◊〉 far exceed
All other perfecc••s / and vertuouse natural
For sensualyte / in very dede
Is but a mean / which causes him to fall
In to much folly / and makes him besty all
So that there is no difference / in that at the lest
Bytwyxt man / and an unreasonable best
¶ But this other / comes of great tenderaūce
and spiritual love / that god owes to mankind
whom he hath create / to his own semblance
and endued / with a wondrous mind
whereby he may well discern and find
Suffysant difference / bytwyxt good and bad
Which is to be left / and which is to be had
¶ Lo this is yt / that doth him dignify
and causes him to be / reputed so excessent
and of all this / the chief doar am I
which from heaven in to earth by god am sent
Only for that cause / and final intent
That I should this his creature / demean and guide•
For the season that he doth in this world abide
¶ Now compare thy virtues / and mine together
and say which is / the wurthyar of them to
¶ Which is the worthier? forsooth I trow neither
we be good felowys.
Nay my friend not so
Thou ought to obey me / where so ever I go
¶ Nay that shall I never do / for to dye
I shall be thy fellow be / loke thou never so hye
¶ And therefore hardly / be somewhat selo wlyke
Leave thyn hawt conceytys / and take a meetly way
For shame of the world man / let vs not strike

And certainly / the fre choice is his
Whiter he will be governed / by the or by me
Let vs therefore put yt / to his own jeopardy

Rather to the worse / than the better part
Butrt be helped / by power supernal
¶ yet Reason / when thou hast said all
if thou se him not / take his own way
Call me cut / when thou metest me another day
¶ For certain yet / according to mine office
I must advertise / and counsel him at the lest
to haunt virtue / and schew all vice
And therein assist him / to the uttermost
and if he will / algatys be a best
And take none heed / to my lore and doctrine
The apparel and hurt / shall be his and not mine
¶ Sirs I shall answer / for this man as yet
That he is maiden / for all such folly
as should distain nature / or dishonour yt
Brought up with me / full well and tenderly
wherefore I dare / the surelyar testify

Both for dede / and eke consent of syn

Than he is vertuouse / and of good living
for fleshly lust / and worldly pleasance
is with innocence / nothing according
But if his behaviour / and daily demeaning
Be of such draught / as reason will allow
I shall him favour / and love as I do now
¶ Well spoken and wisely / now have ye all done?
Or have ye ought else / to this man to say
¶ O sir ye.
piece no more of this dysputacyd
Here be many fantasies / to drive forth the day
That one chatreth like apye / that other like aiay
And yet when they both / have done what they can
Māgry them teeth / I shall rule the man

At wyxt my reason / and sensualyte
That one means well / and that all other amiss
In one is sekernes / and in tother great frailty
And both they be / so annexed to me
That need I must / with one of them abide
Lord as thou thynkyst best / for me do provide
¶ For I am wondrously / entryked in this case
and almost brought / into perplexyte
Not withstanding / thanked be thy grace
as I did never assent / no agree
To thing that should / be contrary unto the
Of sinful ded / and thought all innocent
Subduyd to reason / as his obedient

that ye were brough / unto the worldys presence
¶ Be yt so in goddess name / I pray you go we hens
¶ And will ye that I / shall for you declare
Unto the world / the cause of your coming
What is your intent / and what parson ye are
¶ ye I wold be glad / that every thing
Be done even / after your devising
¶ Shall I than stand / as I were tong tide
¶ ye hardly / till reason have said
¶ Sir world / yt is the mind and also pleasure
Of lady nature / as she bad vs to you tell
that ye accept / and receive this her creature
With you for a season / here to dwell
Despryng you heartily / to entreat him well
with all the favour / that ye can deuyse
Wherein ye shall do her / great pleasure and service
¶ Sirs ye be welcome / to vs heartily
your messagye is / to vs right acceptable
Be ye assured / there is nothing erthly
to vs so joyful / no yet so delectable
As to be acquainted / with parsons honourable
Namely souch / as ye seem to be
Men of high honour / and of great dygnyte
¶ And as touching the message / that ye have brought
Have thereof / the full mind and intent
Assuring you that our bysy thought
Shall be to do / dame naturys commandment
and thereunto / we will be diligent
To do her pleasurys / in that we may
And so we wold / ye should to her say
¶ And were ye show / unto me that this man
Is ordained to reign / here in this empry
I assent well / for or nature began
To shape the world / the thought fynally
to ordain man / therein to occupy
He to take upon him / as mighty governor
Having all thing / subdued to his power.
¶ Wherefore I receive / greatly his coming
Mankind sir / heartily welcome ye be
ye are the parsone / without feigning
that I have evermore / desired to se
Come let me kiss you. O benedycyte
ye be all naked / alas man why thus
I make you sure / yt is right perilous.
¶ I thank you / but I need none other vesture
Nature hath clothed me / as yet suffysantly
Gyltles of syn / and as a maiden pure
I were on me / the garment of innocence
¶ ye hardly were that garment continually
It shall thy body / suffysantly safeguard
From stormy weder my life to ieopard
¶ Be piece / fair woman ye are not very wise
Care ye not / if this body take cold
ye must consider / this is not paradise
No yet so temporate / by a thousand fold
Whose so lives here / be he young or old
He must suffer / both fervent cold and hete
And be out of temperance / oft time in his diet
¶ Also he must needs / do as the world doth
That intends any while / here to reign
And follow the gyse that now a day goth
As for as his estate / may yt maintain
And who doth the contrary / I will be plain
He is abyect / and despised utterly
and stands ever banished / from all good company
¶ Sith god therefore / had ordained this body
To dwell here / in this erthly region
Of convenience / he must him self apply
To worldly thing{is} / and be of such condition
As all men be / and leave eche fond opinion
That is not approuable / of wiser men than he
to take such way / yt is but vanyte.
¶ Take this garment / man do as I you bid
Be not ashamed / hardly to do yt on
So so / now this gurdell / have gurd yt in the mid
And this for your head / go set yt upon
By the charge of me / you be a goodly on
As ever I saw / sith yt I was borne
Worth a thousand / that ye were beforne.
¶ Give me your hand / be not in fere
Sytdown / as ye are borne to occupy this place
I give you here / auctoryte and power
Over all thing / that conceived is in the space
Of all the earth / that round is in compace
To be as lord / of every region
and thereof I give you / possible possession.
¶ Blessyd be thou / my lord most bounteous
that of thy great / abundant charity
Me thy wretched creature / hast honoured thus
with natural gyftys / and worldly dygnyte
Now I beseke the / for thy great pity
Sith thou hast set me / in so noble way
Suffer me not here after / wrechedly to decay
¶ For certes yt is / mine hartys desire
So to domain me / in this life present
As may be most / unto thy pleasure
and unto nature / not dysconuenyent
This is my will / and my chief intent
this will I observe / thy grace to borrow
though I therefore / suffer mouche worldly sorrow
¶ Forsooth these words / be greatly to allow
if they from meke / and lowly hart proceed
Now mankind / sith thou hast made this vow
Scope the thereafter / thy life to led
And set thy world / be cousin to thy dede
that is to say / do thou none other wise
Than thou here openly / to god dost promise
¶ ye sir and ever / loke that ye abstain
Not only from dede / but also from the assent
So that ye commit / neither of them twain
if ye will observe / the high commandment
For surely ye may / not be cleped innocent
Nor gyltles of syn / as for as I can find
if onys ye assent / to folly in your mind.
¶ This is an harde word / sister that ye have spoken
An hard word surely / and an heavy sentence
But thynk ye goddess / commandment broken
For a light tryfull / and matter of insolence
Alas have ye such a spiced conscience
That will be entryked / with every merry thought
Leave yt woman leave yt. For yt is nought
¶ And man as for you / ye shall not take that way
That manner of observance / is to hard and strait
ye must attempt the world / and therein assay
Whether ye can live / after that endrayte
These. ii. folk / harp both on refrayte
and ever enbesyeth them / to rebuke you of syn
¶ That never was spotted / no fownd guilty therein
take none heed of them / their words be but wind
and as for this time / I command them to silence
And set vs se now / how prettily ye can find
By sage polycy / and worldly prudence
To maintain the state / in honour and reverence
that ye shall be in / while ye in the world dwell
Speak of this matter / and ponder yt well
¶ First me seems necessary / to provide
What manner folks / your servants shall be
For surely ye are / nothing accompanied
according / to a man of your degre
ye have here with you. ii. parsons or. iii.
That pleases you happily / in the best wise
yet yt appears not so / to every monies ges.
¶ What man is this?
¶ Reason sir my chief conselour
And this innocence / my noryce hyderto
And sensualyte that other / by whom I have power
To do / as all sensate bestys do
But reason and innocence / chiefly these two
Have the hole rule / and gouerny of me
To •••m eke is subdued / my sensualyte
¶ For certain sir / reason hath done me wrong
More than ever he shall be able to recompense
God knows sir I thought / the season very long
Till we were brought / unto your presence
But now I pray you / to adnull the sentence
That nature gave unto me / by reasons advise
to my great hurt / and vttyr preindyce
¶ And sir I ask / none amends erthly
But that reason / may have a chek mate
A little knack / a little prayty congy
His haut courage / some thing to abate
For hyderto / he hath kept great estate
And had of me / the over hand and strengar
But ye not displeased / I will suffer yt no lengar
¶ Thou hast had great wrong / and that is pity
For if thou be the parson / that I take the fore
thou sholdyst be / as honourable as he
¶ Lord ye say well / but woldgod ye wold se
Some manner help / and remedy for this evil
And let me not always / live this like a dryuyll
¶ Sir ye know well / that if so yt were
A man should suddenly / come to a strange place
Wherein he is / but alyand and stranger
He must needs be / compelled in that case
to put him self / in the favour and grace
Of some syngler person / that can show him the way
Of all the behauour / and gyse in that contrary
¶ So yt is now / that ye be hyder sent
this contrary as yet / to you unknown
In mine opinion / yt is expedient
to take some other counsel than your awne
Of well inured men / such as have grown
In worldly experience / and have thereof the drift
And can best for you / in time of need skyft
¶ Certes ye move / right well and prudently
and I am well content / that yt so be
But as yet / have I not the polycy
To know which men / have most ability.
¶ Dare ye commit / the matter unto me
¶ 〈◊◊〉 well / I am fully content
That all thing be done / by your assygnement
¶ Thā thus I will / that aboue all thing
From hens forward / ye be like and conformable
Unto other parsones / in all your demeaning
Namely to such / as be companable
Be they never so vycouse / or abominable
For every man / clepyth him wise
That doth after the come gyse.
¶ And as for men / that should do you service
I know divers persons / that be right honourable
That can you serve / always point deuyce
In all the world / be there none so able
So wise / so politic / no yet so profitable
Lo here is one of them / that I speak fore
and he him self can tell you / where ye shall have more
¶ Worldly affection is this monies name
He is well brained / and wondrous of invention
a fore casting man / and payne of shame
ye shall not find / in any christen region
a wiser fellow / in things to be done
Specially of maters / that be concerning
Worldly pleasure / that is for you according
¶ Suffer him therefore / never to depart
But if yt be / for maters of great substance
and for sensualyte / I pray you with all my heart
To accept him to your favour and tendraunce
He hath ben lunge / of mine acquaintance
and on my faith / my heart can not but grudge
To think that ye should use him as a drudge
¶ Do as he aduyseth you / hardly now and than
and despise not / utterly his counsel
Think that ye be here / a worldly man
and must do as men / that in the world dwell
ye are not bound / to live like an angel
No to be as god / always immutable
Monies nature / of him self is full miserable
¶ I have told you now / my counsel and advise
And ye have promised / to be ruled thereby
Now set eche man / execute his office
and se how wisely / ye can them occupy
To increase the world / and yt thereto ye must apply
〈1 line〉
Now address you thereto / and demean you thus
I shall be to you ever good and prosperous
¶ 〈◊◊◊〉 of this courtesy
•…nde 〈◊〉 as yet, but be ye sure
I sh•… 〈◊〉 self / endeavour bysyly
to do that may be / to your pleasure
And for the season / that I shall her endure
I shall 〈◊◊〉 / and to my power maintain
That unto you in any wise do pertain
¶ Than to bygyn with all I will advise you
to put this man / from your company
I tell you / every man will despise you
As long as ye / be ruled by innocence
to follow such counsel / yt is but folly
For he can neither good neither evil
and therefore he is taken / but for a dryuyll
¶ By my faith / euyn as ye say
It likes me not right well
With innocence lunge to dwell
therefore according to your counsel
I will not after this day
with his company my self offer
As me wet as yt were a gray frere
I suppose there is no man here
what soever he be
That could in in his mind be content
all ways to be called an innocent
Wherefore yt is mine intent
to do as ye advise me
¶ ye hardly do euyn so
¶ Forsooth and I hold me well content
to depart at your commandment
ye shall find me obedient
What soever ye bid me do
¶ So the company is well amend
Let him go to the devil of hell
He is but a boy I warn you well
and should ye follow his counsel
All mighty god defend
if ever ye sust to play the man
It is time that ye now bygone
Mar• to play the boy now and than
For your 〈◊◊◊〉
It forces not though ye do
Wh•… ye may have ••ser thereto
And among I will help you also
In due time and place
¶ ye that ye will indeed
But now sir will ye any thing
Command me byfore my departing
¶ Nothing at all to my w•tyng
But our lord have you in his kypyng
And send you well to speed
¶ Worldly affection come hyder / ye are politic
and much better inured / in this world than I
I pray you dispose for me / as ye thynk most like
That I may live here well and honourably
¶ ye sir I shall. Dout ye not hardly
if yt like you / to put me in so great trust
And I true ye shall find me / true and just
¶ I wot well I shall. Surely you be bound
To the world / that hath given you so great cōmendacy••
¶ ye sir some men had lever than a thousand pound
They might be commended / of the same fassyon
But sir set pass / all this commendation
and answer to me / I pray you frutefully
In that I shall move you / substancyally
¶ Sir at few words / I you exhort
Sith that ye be come to your own
Cast your self to bear such a port
That as ye be / ye may be known
Eke yt is necessary / for that behove
that there be made / some manner of puruyaunce
Whereby / ye may here out your countenance
¶ Will yt like you therefore that I survey
And se thextent / of all your land
and there upon / in all the hast purvey
Both for you and yours / all manner of viand
with other vtensyttys / ready at your hand
So that ye be purueyd / all times early and late
Of eche thing / that belonged to your estate
¶ your counsel ye good / do as ye thynk best
I commit all such thing / to your discretion
¶ I shall do my true / bysynes at the lest
To bring all things / to good conclusion
¶ Abide 〈◊〉 affection / ye made no mention
Who should await / and give attendance
I must have mo servants / what so ever chance
¶ What ye howe Sensualyte / 〈◊〉 never other counsel
Of such 〈◊◊〉 can you best advise
He knows where / all such manner parsons dwell
as be most 〈◊◊〉 worldly service
¶ ye on my ••rell sir / I shall take the enterprise
Of all such maters / and loke where I find
any man of pleasure / on him set your mind
Lo will ye se lo / here comes one
Even the last man / that was in my thought
¶ What is he.
ye shall se anon
a well drawn man is he / and a well taught
That will not give his head for nought
And thereto goodly / as ye shall se in a day
As well apparelyd / at eche point of his array
¶ Who dwells here / will no man speak
Is there no foal nor body peke
Now by the bell yt were almys to break
Some of these knaves brows
A gentleman comic in at the doris
That all his days hath worn gilt sperys
And none of this knaves nor cutted horys
Byddys him welcome to house.
¶ Wot ye not how great a lord I am
Of how noble progeny I cam
My fader a knight my my moder called madame
Mine aunceters great estatys.
And now the lyuelod is to me fall
By both their dethes natural
I am spoken of more than they all
Hens to parys gatys.

In the best wise I dare well say
By that ye know me a while
And one thing I put you out of dout
I have wherewith to bear yt out
As well as any man here about

and muse as yt w•…reon a maze
New brought into the land
¶ Ha ha ha now by the mary virgin
This will set him on a merry pyn
Even as yt should be
But ever I am in great fere
That Reason will whyster him in the ere
and tome his mind clean fro this ger
This thing fereth me
¶ Reason nay nay hardly
He is forsaken utterly
Sith I cam to his company
He wold not onys appear
Nevertheless for a surte
Worldly affection I advise the
as shortly as ever yt may be
For speed of the matter
To bring him shortly in acquaintance
With all the company of mine affiance
and settheym give continual attendance
Every man bysyly
after the property of his office
Than shall ye se him utterly dospyce
Reasons counsel on warren•…ise
and forsake him utterly
¶ Nay nay sirs care ye nothing
That matter is sped well and fine
¶ Is yt so.
ye by heaven king.
Even as we sat together at the wine
¶ Thou shalt have goddess blessing and mine
but is yt true
¶ ye sir by this day
Our master and Reason have made a great fray
¶ Now so
¶ 〈◊〉 farth we sat together
〈◊◊◊〉 hereby
〈◊◊〉 who should come together
〈◊◊◊〉 and margery
〈◊◊〉 you •…rde so pra•…lie
〈◊◊◊◊〉 the last morning
〈◊◊◊〉 while 〈◊〉 say •…ping
¶ I 〈◊◊〉 ye •…no well I now
〈◊〉 that is nothing to this purpose
〈◊〉 on thy tale for god avow
¶ I 〈◊◊〉 had I wiped my nose
〈◊◊〉 I spied them anon I rose
an•… called them unto me by name
And without more taryeng anon they came
¶ And sat down with vs / &amp; made nothing straūg
as they be full curteys / ye know yt well
And anon our masters colour bygone to change
whereof yt cam / I can not tell
His chere was appalled / every dell
and scant that he could speak to me one word
But s•…ert him even up and rose fro the board
¶ He said he wold go / lie down on a bed
and prayed me for the manners sake
That margery might com hold his heed
Which as he told me / bygone to ache
And so she hath him undertake
To make him hole / in an hour or twain
when soever he hath any such soden pain
¶ What yt means I wot never
But he syketh her phy•…yk so well
That I trow the devil of hell
Can not them two dysseuer
¶ Lo this have I done / and what trow ye more
yet can I tell you better tiding
what is that.
¶ Mary Reason that ye two spake of byfore
Ca•… even to vs as we sat so drinking
And gave our master an hete worth an hanging
Because that margery sat on his kne
while that other whore sat talking with me
¶ My master saw that he could have no rest
Never be rid of this controlling
He prayed the man and thought yt best
〈◊◊◊◊◊〉 my 〈◊〉
〈◊◊◊〉 •…ut more ta•…young
〈◊◊〉 Reason so 〈◊〉 the head
〈◊◊◊〉 •…ruayll but he be now dede
¶ 〈◊〉 •…an fill all t•…e cups at ones
〈◊〉 this be true
〈◊◊〉 these, 〈◊〉
〈◊◊〉 never a word
¶ Trowyst thou yt is no feigned strife
Bytwyxt them two
¶ No on my life.
For when they fought I ran between
and cried keep piece and leave debate
But ye wold have laughed had ye scene
How I departed them / and for all that
Sometime I clapped Reason on the pate
and cried keep the piece as fast as I could
Till I was horse I cried so loud
¶ But can our master play the man now
and fare with this ger
¶ ye make god avow
And beware ye of one thing
Medyll ye no more with margery
For by cokkys precious body
If our master may yt espy
Or have an understanding
That ye use her company
I tell you he will be angry
He is so full of jealousy
As ever I knew man
¶ Jealousy piece man be styll
He can thereof no manner of skill
¶ No but say what ye will
I am sure he can
¶ He is now as familiar
With bodily lust as ever ye were
ye and thereto as great a swearer
When time requires
Knew I never of his age
A man of better courage
To do all manner of outrage
After our desires
¶ Sith Reason and he were thus at variance
He hath be full of such dalliance
And both called to his favour and a•…quayntaunce
•…ur 〈◊〉 by and by
•…uy wreth glotony and co•…se
Sloth and lechery become to his ser•…ice
And utterly he hatyth their 〈◊〉
And that he professes o•…enly
¶ And be these folk of his retinue
¶ ye euerychon on I tell you true
But mary there names be changed new
For to blere his eye
I tell you he is a serefull man
For Reason styrreth him now and than
And therefore do we what we can
It is little I now hardly
¶ Sir a there is first Pride as ye wot well
The sweet darling of the devil of hell
How his name is changed ye can tell
¶ ye mary on the best wise
Wurshyp I wene is now his name
¶ ye by the rode even the same
And couetyse to eschew all blame
Doth his name dysgyse
And calls him self worldly polycy
Wreth because he is somwat hasty
Is called manhood. Then is there envy
and he is called disdain
Glotony for good felyshyp is taken
and sloth his old name hath forsaken
And as fair a name hath he shapen
as ever man could ordain
He is called ease right comfortable to the blot
Specially for them that lust to do no good
and among all other I wold ye understood
That lechery is called lust
Lo these be fair names pard
Both good and honest as seems me
as for their conditions what they be
ye know well
¶ •…ery just
I know their conditions on the best wise
if they keep styll their old gyse
¶ yes that they do on warantyse
¶ But yet I have gr•…t maruay•…
that couetyse should dwell in his company
¶ 〈◊◊〉 troth so / and so have I
But one thing I ensure you faithfully
And that I have espied well
that 〈◊〉 •…derto our master sets no store
By his council nor his lore
Mary when his head waxes whore
than shall be good season
To follow couetyse and his way
ye time I now another day
Even so I hard our master say
¶ By my faith he said but reason
but all the remanent be well retained
¶ ye be ye sure yt is matter unfeigned
And wot ye who is greatly disdained
With our master now
¶ Who
¶ By god even shamfastnes
when he shall do any such excess
No shame can fere him doubtless
I may say to you
¶ No than the craft were nought
but now sirs well bethought
Sith the matter is hereto brought
It is time for me
To go and make some provision
Of garmentys after the new invention
As he commanded me to be don
thereto must I se
For yt is committed to my negligence
And if he come hyder while I am hens
I pray the excuse mine absence
¶ ye and mine also
¶ Why will thou go with me
¶ Will I {quod} a ye pard
It is according for Sensualyte
With Pride for to go
¶ Now ye matter is all most in good case
After the world is mind and pleasure
there is no more / but now must I cupace
With all my wit and bossy endeuure
how it may be stablysshed &amp; cōtynued sure
For a little fantasy of monies own will
May quail this matter and utterly yt spy•…
And if he vary again
of scrypyll imagination
Or else by the suggestion
Of the foresaid reason
One thing I am certain
He will no lengar me support
And that were a shrewd crank dor•…
Therefore yt is best that I resort
to my masters presence
And se of what demeanour he is
I am greatly to blame I wis
For that I saw him not or this
Sith he departed hens.
¶ O good lord / to whom shall I complain
And show the sorrows of my mind
and nothing for mine own cause certain
But only for the decay of mankind
which now of late is waxen so blind
That he hath despised and forsaken me
And followed every motion of his sensualyte
¶ What aduayled at the beginning
that Nature committed me to his service
and charged me that byfore all thing
Of all his gydyng I should take thenterpryse
when he lusts not to follow mine advise
but followed thappety•… of his sensual affection
As a brute best that lakketh reason
¶ And yet not withstanding
that he doth me disdain
I will resort to him again
And do my labour and bysy pain
To assay if I can him refrain
•…to such beastly living
but first will I stand hereby
In secrete manner to espy
Some token of grace in him whereby
I may discern and find
that he hath any shamfastnes
After his great surfeit and excess
And if yt be so doubtless
It sha•… content my my•…
¶ I say sirs where is wurshyp can ye tell
In this place I left him last
¶ Sir I warrant you he is occupied well
In ordaining your garmentys full fast
He departed fro me in great hast
For that intent / and so he desired
That I wold tell you when need required
¶ He showed me his mind or he went
How he had devised your garment
And if yt be made after that intent
as he told me
When ye were on that vestour
Every man shall do your honour
as becummeth a man of your hauyour
And so yt should be
¶ ye but what will Reason say
When he sees me in that array
¶ Reason. Mary let him go play
To the devil of hell
He promised me at the beginning
That ye wold no more be under his gydyng
¶ No but yet yt were according
To have therein his counsel
Man without reason is but blind
And if I should speak after my mind
I can well a difference find
Bytwyxt man and a best
When he hath Reason in presence
and duly obeys his saw and sentence
¶ Why have ye such a spiced conscience
Now within your breast
that changes your mind so suddenly
I am sorry and ashamed truly
On your behalf
¶ No force hardly
Thouledest me all wrong
and therefore will I no more follow the
¶ Not worldly affection?
¶ Nparde
Nor yet thy brother Sensualyte
I have followed you to long
¶ Is that your mind
¶ ye doubtless
And now will I seek shamefastness
By whom I trust I shall redress
All my mysded
¶ And sith thou will needs to shame bow
I pray god send the shame I now
and yet I trust make god avow
Ones thou shalt have need
To call me again to thy service
¶ Nay nay on warantyse
Now sirs who can me advise
what is best to do
¶ Sir if ye lust to have mine acquaintance
I am ready to give you attendance
Happily my service shall you advance
I am called shamfastnes
¶ By your troth are ye the same
¶ ye forsooth that is my name
Almys deeds I can atom
And help for to repress
when ye have done offence or syn
if ye will mercy and grace wyn
with shame fastness ye must bygyn
This way must ye take
¶ ye be the man without feigning
That I wished for / or ye cam here
and glad am I now of your coming
Praying you with hart enter
when I have need thus to com ne'er
¶ So will I do ye may trust yt verily
When soever ye call ye shall find me ready
¶ Sir is yt your mind to do as ye say
¶ ye that is yt as god me speed
Hard ye all this matter ye or nay
¶ yes that I did in very ded
¶ O ghostly reason I have greater need
Of your help than ever I had byfore
Help me now &amp; I shall never forsake you more
Sith I forsook your company
I have committed much folly
I am ashamed certainly
when I think thereon
Bu•… now have I refused 〈◊〉
All such manner of company
and three have I done verily
Of mine own motion
¶ Than my help shall be ready as oft as ye me ta•…
It is my duty so for to do
And of your offences will I make no rehearsal
But what soever ye have done hyderto
To me ward set yt pass and go
Against god your offence is great
Of the which matter I will not lunge treat
¶ But this confort of me ye shall have
if ye be contrite as ye pretend
God is mercyable if ye lust to crave
Call for grace and soon he will yt send
And be not in purpose hereafter to offend
accustom your self in the ways of virtue
And be not in doubt grace will ensue
¶ Sir yt is my mind and intent
Hereafter to be your true obedient
and never more to assent
To such folly again
¶ And upon that condition
I take the unto my tuition
with all hartys affection
Never to part at wain
And for this season
Here we make an end
Lest we should offend
This audience / as god defend
It were not to be don
ye shall understand never thelesse
That there is much more of this process
wherein we shall do our besynes
and our true endeuure
To show yt unto you after our guise
when my lord shall so deuyse
It shall be at his pleasure
¶ I assemble the life of mortal creature
To the allyege again a s•…rong town or castle
In which there is much b•…st endenure
much warly polycy with bysy travail
On every side which par•…e shall prey ayll
By sleyght of engines or by strong power
that other to subdue and bring into danger
¶ In such case and manner of condition
Is wretched man here in this life erthly
While he abides within the garrison
Of the frail carcass and carynouse body
Whom to impugn laboured incessantly
the world / the flesh / the enemy / these three
Him to subdue and bring into captyuyte
¶ And for to show you what wise they vs ipugn
First doth the world give vs an allectyfe
to couetryches and worldly renown
With other vanyteys that be used in this life
Next that our flesh which ever is in stryse
again our spirit / doth provoke and excite
Is to accomplish our sensual appetite
¶ The last of all is our great enemy
Which ever hath vs in continual hated
Of old enkankred malice and envy
that he owes to vs and all the kindred
Of all the aunceters of whom we do succeed
Nor yetcesseth his malice unto this day
Is to endanger in all that he can or may
¶ And certes these our said enemies
Be of their nature so mighty and so strong
That hard yt will be for vs in any wise
Again them war or battle to vnderfong
also our garrisons and fortress to maintain long
Again their engines without spiritual grace
We can not perform in no manner case
¶ Wherefore yt is to vs right behouable
Besyly to pray to god that is immortal
Beseeching him as he is mercyable
To have compassion and pytye on vs all
And not to suffer vs any wise to fall
Into such folly and utter mischance
Is 〈◊〉 them grieve and do 〈◊◊〉
¶ Also yt behooves on our part
To fl all such manner of occasion
as may be put in fere and Jeopardy
Of their displeasure in any con•••cyon
New fangl•…s and c〈◊◊〉nice 〈◊〉
we must forsake in all manner wise
And acquaint vs with their contrar•se
Queen contrary contraries curantur. &amp;c.
I tell this tale sir to you
Trusting that yt be not done in wast
ye remember as I suppose well I now
Now yt is not fully. in. days past
Sith ye me promised and bound yt fast
From that day forth to be obedient
unto my counsel and advisement
¶ ye sir so I did in very ded
And yet yt is my mind and intent
To follow the same have ye no dread
¶ if ye do not your self shall repent
Now fare ye well for I must be absent
As for a season / and for your confort
when so ever ye call me I shall to you resort
¶ God forbed that ever he com again
Iesu how may ye this life endure
Me seems yt should be to you a great pain
Sith ye be of good complexion and nature
To forbere the worldly sport and pleasure
As ye have done now a great season
and all by the foolish counsel of reason
¶ Where is your lusty hart bycom
That served you so well this other day
Now so help me god and halydom
I have great marvel how ye may
Live in such misery / and this dare I say
without ye take some other ways
By my troth yt will shorten your days
¶ And though I say yt that were pity
For by cry and ye were gone
Meny a good fellow wold make great moan
¶ Why weep ye so
¶ let me alone
It will none other wise be
and ye saw the sorrowful countenance
Of my company your old acquaintance
that they make
For your sake
I dare say ye wold moan them in your mind
They be so loving and so kind
That I am sure
if ye endure
In this peevish opinion
It will be their confession
There is none other remedy
But for sorrow they shall dye
¶ Nay god forbed they should so do
¶ In faith without ye help thereto
There is none other way
¶ I will help yt in all that I may
And I wit by what mene
¶ Mary call them to your company
¶ By saint Ihān I am content
For I may say here to the
Sith I forsook my liberty
And did to Reason assent
I had never merry day
But lived under awe and dread always
Nothing to mine intent
Another while I will me disport
and to mine old company resort
¶ O than shall ye them confort
and your self also
Wot ye who will be very glad
¶ Who
¶ Margery
¶ Why was she sad
¶ ye by the mass she was stark mad
Even for very wo
When she hard tell of this chance
And because she wold live in penance
Her sorrow for to quench
She hath entered into a religious place
At the grene friars hereby
¶ ye has.
Alak good 〈◊〉 wench
Is yt an house of strayt religion
¶ ye as any that ever was bygone
Sith the world stood
¶ Be they close nonnes as other be
¶ Close {quod} a nay nay pard
That gyse were not good
ye must beware of that ger
Nay all is open that they do there
As open as a gos eye
¶ And comes any man into their sellys
¶ ye ye god forbede else
It is fre for every body
And bysyde all this they be
Ex omni gent cognite
No nation they forsake
Without yt be beggars going by the way
That have never a penny to pay
For that that they do take
¶ And yet can I beggars thyderlede
Where they shall be for lumps of breed
Satisfy their desire
Such drabs some there be
That require none other fe
Nor yet any other hire
¶ Be they not wedded as other folk be
¶ Wedded quote a no so mot I the
They will notary therefore
they can wed them self alone
Com kiss me Ihān gramercy Ione
This wed they ever more
And yt is the more to commend
For if the woman hap to offend
as yt is their gyse
a man may let her alone with sorrow
and wed another whore on the morrow
Even of the same wise
¶ Forsooth this is a noble religion
It styrreth me to great devotion
For to se that place
Can thou bring me thither well I now
¶ ye and yt were mid night I make god avow
As dark as ever yt was
¶ But where is bodily lust now
¶ Then comes in bodily lust with him w. aff.
¶ Mary sir I have sat and sought you
This three or. iiii. howrys

All this. ii. days I could not the espy
¶ Sir ye know well that ye and I
Be never much a sonder
alb yt I be from you among
¶ And now me seems thou hast tarried to long
which is to me great wonder
¶ Wonder ye pard for an hour or twain
Forth for a passing while and com again
Here is a sore matter
when was I so long absent as now
and yet I was for to seek you
at the tother side of the water
The place that ye wot of pard
Understand ye what ye mene
¶ ye ye
¶ Tell me in mine ere
¶ Quid est latinum propter le stewys
¶ What latin now this of the nephews
I herd never this ere
I trow ye begin to wax shamfast
¶ Nay nay hardly that ger is past
Meny days a gon
I am as wanton as ever I was
¶ It were alms to hang you else by the mass
By the hard neck bon
But will ye now go with me to a place
and I shall show you the smorterst place
That ever ye saw with eyes
¶ What thing is yt young or old
¶ What ever yt be yt is able to be sold
It shall like you on the best wise
¶ For my love let vs some night be there
at a banquet or a rear supper
and get vs some wanton mete
So we may have some deynty thing

where so ever I yt get
¶ Nay nay will ye spend a coyell of crowns
and there shall no gentleman in this. x. towns
Be better served than ye
Nor be received more honestly
As to an house of bawdry
For a banquet or •…nkry
For a dyshe. ii. or three
¶ yes that will I spend with all mine hart
¶ By your leave I will depart
To make ready this ger
¶ What now in all this hast

She hath disappointed me or now
¶ yet on my faith sir and I were as you
at the lest I wold excuse me
Send her word that ye in no wise
May this night keep her promise
And if ye do not so
She will so morn that as I thynk
Of all this night she will sleep no wink
She shall be so full of wo
¶ ye on my apparel take no care
This answer will I differ and spare
till I be certain
what answer bodily lust shall bring
Of this other pretty new thing
when he comes again
¶ Will yt please you that I go to mergery
In your stead
¶ Mary that were merry
would thou serve me so
¶ Why sir by my troth I mene but well
¶ ye what thou menyst I can not tell
But that shall thou not do
¶ In good faith sir ye may do worse
For while I have any thing in my purse
Or any penny to spend
I will make her even such chere
As I wold mine own wife if she were here
Else god defend
¶ ye I thank the for thy good will
But as for that chere keep yt styll
Till I call thereon
¶ By god sir for good love I spake yt
And now that I se ye will not take yt
I shall let yt alone
¶ How now hast thou been yonder away

Et que nouellys

¶ Mary she her self told me so
when I rapped at the door
¶ It seems she was not a sleep than
¶ No she was a bed with a strange man
¶ A mischief on her whore
I wold this fire were i her tayll I make god avow
¶ That needs not she is hot I now
It were more alms to get
Some cold water her fire to quench
I tell you yt is as warm a wench
As any in all this street
I supposed I had angered her ill
¶ How so
¶ For I rang her a knyll
That waked her from her sleep
I gave her a pele for her frendys soulys
a man might have hard the noise from poulys
To the farthest end of chepe
She saw that I wold not face but knok
And rap styll at the gate
She opened a window and put forth her head

〈◊〉. q. title we have a bry
This ger goes all wide
And so I cam thens a great pace
till I cam hyder / lo this is the case
Have I not well hyde
¶ Well man there is no more to do
that we cannot have we must forgo
there is none other remedy
Lo worldly affection now may thou se
Thy counsel was nought that thou gave me
¶ No more yt was truly
¶ ye I told the asmyche byfore
It is good to be sure ever more
therefore now let vs go
And resort again to our old hostess
that is the best way now as I guess
¶ ye hardly do so
¶ Sirs remember ye that this other day
Man promised me even in this stead
that I should with him dwell and now I here say
The wild worm is com into his head
So that by reason only he is led
It may well be so / but I am sure
that Reason shall not always with him endure
¶ Me thinks that Sensua. doth not his part
according to the duty of his office
for no body can better torn a monies hart
Nor yet a readier mean deuyse
to put away such foolish fantasyse
than Sensualyte if he lust to assay
for he is chief ruler when Reason is away
¶ ye / a ruler will I be though Reason say nay
¶ Ah Sensualyte welcome by this day
what tidings good
¶ ye by my fey
as good as can be told
I have brought this man to his old gyse
¶ Hast thou so
¶ ye on warantyse
¶ Now forsooth I give the pryk and pryse
Thou 〈◊◊◊◊◊〉
Of this tidings I am glad and fain
But shall I be welcome to him again
and all our company
¶ ye hardly
as welcome as ever ye ware byfore
¶ Goddess blessing have thyn hart therefore
thus am I in thy det more and more
¶ Iapes why say ye so
¶ for I speak yt after my mind
thou art to me always so kind
But where shall I our master find
to him will I go
¶ He is bossy hark in your ere
with little margery ye wot where
And as soon as I had brought him there
I cam my way a pace
and because he should not be alone
I left with him worldly affection
and other erand had I none
Now to this place
but even to show you what is done
and from hens I must anon
for to seek an other companion
to give attendance
¶ Who is that
¶ Mary glotony
Our master calls for him besyly
Sawyst thou him not
¶ No certainly
To my remembrance
¶ I must go seek him without any taryeng
But Pride I warn you of one thing
While I thynk thereon
when my master and ye shall mete
In any wise se that ye him great
In the old fassyon
And make as though ye know nothing
Of his divers and variable dealing
Keep that in your breast
ye can not do him more displeasure
Than thereof to make reporture
Therefore let yt rest
〈◊◊◊〉 •…gh treason

〈◊◊〉 the better were
B•…th •…s warning I shall be wise
And do as ye me advertise

¶ Will ye be wise quote a / mary that is a thing
By god ye had need to have better warning
Or ye bring that about
¶ What brother Sloth fro whens comyst thou
¶ Straight fro my bed I make god avow
Mine eyes be almost out
for lak of sleep / but this sir to you
Me thought ye called me sloth right now
Piece no more of that
I have a new name as well as ye
¶ What is that / ease
¶ ye pard
But yt forces not
while our master is not present
Between vs twain I am content
Call me what ye will
But where is our master
¶ Wotest thou ne'er
¶ No
¶ No more do I
¶ There there there
Thou shalt dwell with me styll
Thou art as good a waiter as I
¶ I shrew the better of vs both hardly
But surely we do not well
we shall not continue with yonder man
but we await better now and than
Therefore by my counsel
Let vs twain go together
To seek our master
¶ But wotyst thou whether
we shall now go
To find our master
¶ I shall assay
Thou shalt se me guess the way
And happily find him to
Now must I to the stews as fast as I may
to •…each this gentleman but sirs I say
Can any man here tell me the way
For I cam never there
ye know the way pard of old
I pray the tell me which way shall I hold
will ye se this whoreson cocold
I trow he cannot here
Now yt were alms to clap the on the crown
¶ Why be there any cocoldys in town
¶ ye I durst hold thereon my gown
that there be a score
but for god I cry you mercy
for by my saith I wit you not so ny
Had I wit yt I ensure you faithfully
that word I wold have forbore
¶ No force hardly yt touches not me
But wurshyp tell me where have ye be
Me thinks long sith I you se
¶ Sir yt is no marvel
Bad ye not me the last day
To go purvey for your array
And ye remember well
¶ ye for god have ye done the same
¶ ye by the rode else were I to blame
All thing is ready in pain of shame
Else I quyte me ill
The tailor told me yester night
that all your garmentys were ready dyght
will ye go thither and have a sight
¶ •…emary with a good will
¶ Will ye that I go with you also
¶ I wot never whether ye may attend thereto
for ye do nothing
But even after your own sweet will
¶ Why should I ever wait nay that I nil
for to be a king
I may not endure continual besynes
I was never used thereto doubtless
I should not live a year
if I followed you I am sure
〈◊〉 and •…our •…ut of me sure
I saw never your pere
He wene there can nothing be do
But if ye put your hand thereto
and I wrs that is no need
ye have servants that be true and just
if yt wold like you to put them in trust
And quyte well they •…e mede
what should I attend you for to please
when I se well ye set by none ease
which belonged to me
¶ Why ease what means the thus to say
I do but ete drink sleep and play
And none other labour pard
¶ ye / ye may say what ye will
But I can never se you idol
And quiet as ye should be
your body laboured as doth an hakney
That bareth the burton every day
That pytye yt is to se
And your mind on that other side
Is never Idol nor unoccupied
I wis yt grieves me
To se you demeaned that wise
I trow ye be set all on couetyse
¶ Cou•…tyse / nay let be
It is a thing of greater cure
That sticks in my mind be thou sure
¶ So me thought by the rode
I wit as much there was some thing
By your •…o wring chere and your sighing
That was not all thing good
But what is the matter I pray you heartily
¶ I wis thou can not deuyse the remedy
with all the wit thou hast
But this is the case to tell yt shortly
A thing was told me as I cam hereby
Now Reason puruayth fast
And makes very great labour and ordinance
To dash vs all out of countenance
And for that purpose
He hath gadred a great company
¶ What to do
¶ I wore ne'er I
But as I suppose
It is to bring me in captyuyte
And to take from my l•…berte
So he hath oft said
¶ •…ere ye that matter
¶ Nay never a dell
but I care for yt wit ye well
Yet am I not afraid
For I wit withstand yt proudly
and sirs I trust ye will stand thereby
when yt shall be need
¶ ye by the way that god went
Or he have of you his intent
First shall I blede
The best blot that is in this carcass
¶ Well ease go thy way hens a pace
and make therein good speed
Call my company all together
and bid them every man com heder
That is with me affeed
¶ Mary sir that shall be do
¶ Wurshyp in the mean time let vs go
To se my new apparel
¶ Will ye so. Now for your ladies sake
Go do yt on you and I undertake
It shall become you well
¶ Worldly affeccy on abide thou here
For I will go do on this new ger
as wurshyp doth me counsel
¶ Mary I shall with all mine hart
this good fire and I will nor depart
For very cold mine hand is do smart
It makes me wo bygone
Get me a s•…whole here may ye not se
Or e•…is a chayr will yt not be
thou piled knave I speak to the
Now •…ong shall I stand
¶ •…et him stand with a foul evil
〈1 line〉
〈◊〉 ye se so / every dr•…will
Now adays I w•…rand
Must command as he were a king
Let him stand on his sete with bredyng
¶ What Glotony / I can tell the one thing
In fa•…th you will be shent
¶ Why
¶ My master hath sent Sensualyte
To seek the all about the country
Spoke thou not with him
¶ yes pard
I know all his intent
And thereupon I am com here
For to awa•…t / but wotest thou where
Our master is now
¶ Nay I wot ne'er
I am not very certain
But Pride and he together begone
No said he wold com again anon
within an hour or twain
Tarry thou here and go net away
I will go break my fast and I may
For I ete never a morsel this day
¶ Mary that is a thing
Go when thou wit I will abide
My stomach he shall not rule or get
That is now fasting
Nay of all thing erthly I hate to fast
Four times a day I make repast
Or thryse as I suppose
And when I am well fed
Than get I me to a soft bed
my body to repose
There take I a nap or twain
•…p I go straight and to yt again
Though nature be net ready
yet have I some mete of delight
For to provoke •…happetyte
And make the stomach greedy
After all this needs I must
Sometime follow the wanton lust
For hot drynkys and delicate reflecyon
Causes flesshely insurreccyon
ye know yt as well as I
¶ Troth as ye say I know yt well
¶ What gentleman is this can ye tell
¶ Wotyst thou never
¶ No by the bell
I saw him never byfore
¶ Is yt our master
¶ Nay by the rood
It is not he would thou make me wood
¶ yes I am the same
¶ I cry you mercy I se yt well now
Byfore I knew you not I make god avow
In ernest nor in game
¶ Why. Because I have changed mine array
¶ For that cause trow ye nay nay
That is not the thing
That can dysceyue me be ye sure
but I pray you who hath had you in cure
Sith my last departing
¶ By my faith a little season
I followed the counsel and diet of reason
¶ There went the hare away
His diet {quod} a / yt may be verily
For ye be haltred marvelously
Altered I wold say
alas the while had ye no mete
As long as ye were under his diet
¶ Mete / yes I had some
without yt were on fasting days
Than he wythdrew my supper always
and gave me never a crom
¶ No force hardly why wold ye than
favour him as ye did like a madman
ye loke now as yt were a gost
Had ye dwelt with him till this day
ye had been pined even away
as ye be now almost
your flesh is gon every dell
A vengeance on the morsel
That is left thereon
¶ Now talk of the remedy
¶ 〈◊〉 now 〈◊〉 the 〈◊〉 and 〈◊〉 safe
〈◊◊〉 ye there none
¶ ye bu•… where ye the m•…te now 〈◊◊〉
¶ ye are •…yng hasty be no d•…
frist must ye go
where as prouer spoon thereof ye made
Let ve go thither and re shall be had
¶ But what to the marsiers of the in
A weddyd woman or a virgin
¶ Nerther of both I joys
〈◊〉 No / but for a maiden she goth
¶ ye forgot that she doth
But yet she ye none by Iye
¶ No / no / what than
¶ I wye I not / but as men clater
They say she ye innupta matter
Hardly an holy woman
¶ Well thither we will / go we hens
¶ Sir ye will give me license
To sport me for a season
¶ yes for a while ye well I now
but go not out of the way I charge you
for hyder will come anon
All my company as I suppose
Keep them together for I purpose
to come again anon
and show them my mind what I will do
¶ Mary I shall do what I can thereto
and yet yt ye hard for me
to keep them together any while
But I shall tell you what
I had sever keep as many fleas
Or wyld hares in an opine less
as undertake that
¶ Wherebe these knaves that make this array
¶ Mary they be gon that other way
tell me whom ye mean
¶ I trow thou scornyst
¶ Nay certainly
How so be yt if I should not lie
at the first blush I ensure you faithfully
I f•…nd forgot you 〈◊〉
〈◊〉 ye be thus defensybly arrayed
〈◊〉 at that are ye afraid
who fiath you grieved
¶ Nay I fere no man that bears an hee
〈◊〉 I sever that I were dede
than that should be proved
¶ By my faith ye are wont to be as bold
as yt were a lyon of cottyswold
but now to my question
what means all this defensible array
¶ Mary sloth warned vs two this same day
Even sith yt was none
that our moister and Reason should make a stay
and therefore he had vs without delay
to await on our captain
¶ A now I know the matter right well
But what shall com thereof I can not tell
It passes my brain
Our master willed that we twain
Should tarry here till he com again
¶ What will thou do than
¶ Who I Ienay care not for me
I will not com where strokys be
I am not so mad a man
And I wis yt is not for any fere
But yt is a thing that I can well forbere
And will as long as I can
Of lust and pleasure is all my mind
It longs to me of property and kind
And if I should to the war
And lie in mine harnes as other men do
•…yth hunger and thirst a day or two
It should me utterly mar
¶ It were a great loss if thou were mart
Now fie on the stath whoreson coward
By cokkys precious blot
It were no syn to sle such a knave
Host not thou wagys as other men have
And few of vs so good
yet will thou fayll vs at this need
Now who so ever shall quyte my mede
〈◊〉 will no further go
〈◊〉 I have 〈◊◊〉 mine own hand
〈◊◊〉 I sh•…d 〈◊〉 were the land
Even when I have do
〈◊◊◊〉 I you re quy•…e
〈◊〉 as wo•… ye not at my desire
Do so my•…e for me
I 〈◊〉 wold have done me more good
to have s•…no the knaves hart blot
than. xx. shrll•… ngys of fee
¶ What how sirs what means this ger,
will ye sle eche other here
No more of this work
¶ By the hart of god and he had abyden
A little while he should never have spoken
with pressed nor with clarke
¶ Who was that
¶ your own minion
Bodily lust
¶ Why what hath he done
¶ Even like a lurden
He saith that ye have given him license,
to abide at home and keep residence
while we bear the burden
And serve you now at your need
¶ He prayed me so in very dede
within these. ii. days
He said he wold serve me with a good will
But of the worries he could no skill
Nor knew thereof the ways
How be yt I gave him thereof none answer
¶ No but I am sure he will not com there
And now ma•… ye se
That no man is so much to blame
As your self
¶ I
¶ ye by saint I am
No man but even ye
for I am well a Jured of one thing
ye gave him better clothing
Than ye did me
And better wagys and fees also
And though I said but little thereto
But suffered ever more
yet I by •…aynd yt ever in my mind
And though that ye were to me unkind
To set so 〈◊〉 at store
By such a knave as he was
I wold I had him here by the mass
And no man but we twain
¶ By my troth this is ever thy guise
Ioke by whom I set any pryse
Him thou will most dysoayn
¶ By cry he can do none other wise
but now sir is there any service
That ye will command me
¶ ye mary is there / but my company
Dresses them forward passing slowly
I trow yt will not be
Manhood thou art good I now for one
¶ ye by cry and they cam every chone
I will not greatly fere
¶ By my troth because he saith so
I shall tell you what I saw him do
I was present there
Sir yt happyned in westminster hall
Even byfore the Iuges all
His handys were bound fast
And never upon him that ever god made
Dagger sword nor knife he had
And yet at the last
He drove. xii. men into a corner
and an howi after durst they not appear
How say ye hereto
and his handys had been at syberte
He woes have put them in great I eoparde
It is to suppose so
¶ Mary there he qurte him well
but where be mine other folk can ye tell
¶ Thē comes i Glotony with a chese i a bottle.
¶ Mary here comes one
Good felyshyp me seems yt should be
¶ Sirs god speed you
¶ What tidings with the
¶ I shall tell you anon
〈◊〉 I am co•… 〈◊〉
For •…o a•…de upon 〈◊〉

¶Why hast thou no•…e 〈◊◊〉 but this
¶What the devil harnes should I mys
without yt be a bottle
Another bottle I will go purvey
Lest that drink be scarce in the way
Or happily none to sell
¶Thou must have other harnes than this man
¶Other harnes nay I shrew me than
I can no skill thereon
why trow thou that I will fight
¶ye so I trow
¶Nay by god almyght
Thereof will I none
I was never wont to that ger
But I may serve to be a vyteler
And thereof shall ye have store
So that I may stand out of danger
Ofgon shot / but I will com no ne'er
I warn you that byfore
¶Now such a knave I betake to the devil
This is even such a another dreuyll
As was here while ere
They be. ii. knaves anointed
I fere me sir ye shall be disappointed
I sick not this ger
¶O I had for gotten I make god avow
Sir my fellow ease commands me to you
¶Commands the to me
¶you to me
¶Me to the
¶Commands you to him I wold have said
¶Why comes he not hyder
¶By god for he is afraid
And lies sick in his bed
He toke such a consext when he hard of this ger
That for thought and very fere
¶And he were hanged yt were no 〈◊〉
I p•…ay god the devil break his no•…
and all such as he is
¶Well l•…t vs suffer for a while
I will go walk hens half a mile
and for all this
Happily all this ger shall not need
Now be yt that I dout and dread
The wurst as wise men do
Manhood com thy self with me
¶And I to sir
¶ye pard
would thou be prayed thereto
¶Now he that wold have war or strife
I pray god send him a shrewd wife
and than shall he have I now
But I shall tell you sirs as for me
I am none of them so mot I the
I may say to you
I will no such rekennyng is abide
Goddess body here comes Pride
as crank as a peacock
As soon as he and I mete
without he stand right upon his fete
He shall bear me a proud mok
¶What tidings sirs can any man tell
¶ye mary that can I do as well
as any that was in field
ye have tarried so long about your gay ger
That the field is done or ye come there
¶Done mary god sheld
¶It is done without fayll
But whyehe of them hath won the balayll
I can not tell you certain
¶Thou were not there yt seems thereby
¶Not I there {quod} ayes hardly / 〈◊〉 that to my great
but as soon as ye batellys joined together (pain
I cam my way straight heder / for to tell tiding•…
¶What the devil tidings can thou tell
¶Mary I can show you nothing of the batell
but of ma•…y other tidings
ye are out of concext I tell you forever
B•…cause 〈◊〉 not you endeuou•…
•…t th•…s great 〈◊〉
I•… so m•…e 〈◊〉 ye ore 〈◊〉 to sees
•…eth 〈◊〉 off•…ce and all your fees
And 〈◊〉 out of wa•…s
¶ That is not true as I suppose
¶ Sir and •…t be not t•…ke my nose
And my head also
your office was given or I cam thens
¶ Mary that was a very short sentence
and I not cassed thereto
Now envy what counsel wit thou give me
¶ By my troth Pride thou may believe me
I•… I were in thy case
I wold wythdrawe me for a season
though yt be another felony nor treason
Nor yet wilful tree space
yet the same is wurst of all
For every knave will the call
a co ward to thy face
¶ I am unhappy I said well
for thexpense of mine apparel
towardys this voyage
what in horses and other array
•…ath compessed me for to say
all my sand to mortgage
and now when I have all do
To less mine office and fees also
For my true intent
I may say that all my cost
and all my time is evil lost
In service that I have spent
well what so ever by tide me
for a season I will hyde me
after thy counsel
and sith yt will no better be
Fare well I take my seue of the
¶ •…ow gentle Pride fare well
Alas that I had no good fellow here
to bear me company and laugh at this ger
this game was well found
¶ yes and ye lust to play the knave
Some manner of company ye might have
S•…e within this ground
¶ Some I can think y•…ng or old
And 〈◊〉 yt were a small household
as any might be found
¶ It is not small the company shows well
But me thought thou were about to tell
Of some merry I este
Or some merry game at my cummyng
¶ ye fardely yt is a game for a hyng
when he lusts best
To laugh for his disport and solace
Sir I shall tell the this is the case
Right now as I stood
In this place and never a man with me
In cam Pride garnished as yt had be
One of the real blot
It grieved me to se him so well be scene
But I have abated his courage clean
For a little season
By the rode I have given him a chek mate
For I bare him an hand that he cam to fate
And that the field was done
and how his office was given away
Because he failed our master that day
I made him to believe so
And when I had told him all this tale
anon he began to wax all pale
Full of care and wo
and now he hydeth him self for shame
I gave him mine advise to the same
and so he is gon
¶ Now on my faith this was madly do
but in faith what moves the thereto
¶ Mary cause had I none
but only that yt is my guise
When I se another man arise
Or fare better than I
Than must I chafe and fret for ire
and imagine with all my desire
To destroy him utterly
But now in ernest Sensualyte
tell me when this fray shall be
I pray ye heartily. ¶ Sensua. What against Rea.
¶ •…e the same
¶ 〈◊〉 they be agreed in yarn of shame
and go•…d company they keep
¶ Agreed 〈◊〉 in the m•…re name
Mary fyr•… at were a game
to make some of vs weep
¶ We•…e or laugh man so yt is
and who trow ye is the •…a user of this
¶ Who
¶ Age the devil him quell
¶ Why is age now com in pl•…ce
¶ ye and that may ye spy by his face
and ye mark yt well
His stomach faints every day
His back crooked his head waxes gray
His nose drops among
His lust is gone and all his liking
I se yt well by every thing
He may not live long
and all makes age as I said byfore
He is the dear / and what trow ye more
this age hath done
¶ What
¶ By my faith he hath brought in Reason
In such wise that at no season
Nothing can be wrought
B•…t Reason must be called thereto
I fere me he will vs all undo
within few days
As soon as Glotony had espied
all this ger he wold not abide
but went even his ways
Our master prayed him to t•…rye a season
Nay nay quote he / now have I done
I may no lengar tarry
For age and I may not together dwell
and straight way he departed fair and well
Bodily lust stood by
and saw that Glotony wold needs be gon
•…aue with the Glotony quote he anon
For I must go with the
So that. 〈◊〉. be gon together
〈◊〉 am there none of them both heder
¶ Never a one that I se
¶ Well they be gon some other way
to get a new master as soon as they may
They can not be ou• urueyd
and as for• as they. ii. were gon
Our master sent for couetyse anon
and ••rtesy him prayed
to await on him well for a year or two
and he hath promised him so to do
as for a year or twain
But Reason may not thereof know
¶ Reason quote a / no so I trow
He will that disdain
but where hath couetyse ben many a day
¶ He dwelled with a pressed as I herd say
For he loves well
Men of the church / and they him also
and lawyers the / when they may tend thereto
will follow his counsel
¶ So men say these as I dwell
but Sensualyte can thou tell
Now in this case
what were best for vs to do
¶ Mary I hold yt best that we go
Ne'er by to some place
and semble together all our company
to here there myndys by and by
and every monies opinion
what shall be best for to do
¶ By my troth and be yt so
I hold yt welldon
¶ Sir I have oft times you advised
to live virtuously / and showed you the way
and that not withstanding / ye have me despised
And followed Sensualyte / meny a day
will ye so continue / ye or nay
If ever ye purpose your self to amend
It is time / for your life draws fast to thend
¶ I can not continue / though I wold
For age hath waned me clean therfro
and yet Reason / when ye me told
Of this ger meny day a go
I 〈◊◊〉 / I should 〈◊◊◊〉
〈◊〉 of your words / great story and d•…
Wold god that my life were to bygyn again
¶ S•eke not thereof / that may not be
a thing don / can not be called again
but the thing / that most fereth me
On your behalf / I tell you plain
Is that ye wold / in no wise abstain
From sinful lustys / as I willed you to do
Till now that age compels you thereto
¶ That is full true / wrthout feigning
as long as mine appetite did endure
I followed my lustys / in every thing
which now by the course and law of nature
And not of my polycy / or good endeavour
Is taken fro me / for ever more
And so can I deserve / no mede therefore
¶ But not withstanding this mine abusyon
I trust that by the help of your good advise
I may be made the child of salvation
¶ yes and ye will sir on warantyse
So that ye utterly forsake and despise
All your old servants in will and dede
and do by my counsel
¶ yes have ye no dread
¶ Than my soul for yours / I lay to wed
ye shall do well / have ye no mistrust
And first to begin with / I you forbed
All manner of despair / and secundly ye must
Put to your mind / and good will
To be recurred / of your great excess
For without your help / yt can not be doubtless
¶ Is in this example / if so be the patient
Of him self / be willing to have any remedy
It is a great furtherance to that intent
So that to the preceptys of physyk he apply
And who so doth the contrary / no maruarll truly
Though he myskary / what should I bring
Any mo examples for so plain a thing
¶ It shall be no need as in this case
I know right well / what ye mean thereby
And that will I follow by gods grace
¶ Than as I told you / yt shall be no maystry
your self confort / and •…o •…aue good remedy
〈◊〉 •…st the great 〈◊〉 that thou hast don
〈◊〉 why the thou hast deserved endless dam•… o•…
¶ •…ut do 〈◊〉 I 〈◊◊〉 the / and •…aue no d•…de
And for to 〈◊〉 the medyeyns / most •…yng
〈◊〉 thy force / do by mr rede
Loke what disease / •…s 〈◊〉 and b•…
take ever such a medyeyn as is 〈◊〉 in w•…yng
So that the contrary in all manner of wrse
Must heal his contrary as physyh doth deuyse
¶ Right so who so lusts fro syn to arise
where he hath in pride / done any offence
He can be helped thereof none other wise
but only by mekenes / that is the recompense
again Wreth and Envy / take charity and patience
take alms dede / again the syn of cove•…rs
¶ And to repress glotyny / acquaint ye with abstynece
Again foul lust of body / take chastrte 〈◊〉 cōtynēce
Much syn grows by Sloth and by Idelnes
and that must be eschewed by mene of good besynes
•…o this be preparatyfys most sovereign
Against thy sores which be mortal
Onles that this medyeyns to them be lain
When thou hast received these preparatyfys all
I will com again if thou me call
And order the further after my mind
〈◊〉 ye but where shall I these preparatyfys find
¶ Thou shalt them find wythm thyn own breast
Of the yt must com / yt must be thy dede
For voluntary sacrifice pleases god best
Thou can not thereof have help or mede
But if this ger of thyn own hart proceed
¶ Well I shall endeavour me to the uttermost
And trll I have found them I shall never rest
But how shall I know them that wot I ne'er
I pray you show me that byfore your departing

Thou shalt know them at the first me•…yng
Of. 〈◊〉. contraries there is but one serving
That is to say when thou knowyst well that o•…
The other contrary is known anon
