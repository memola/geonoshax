THaboūdant grace of the power divine
which doth illumine ye world environ
P•eserue this audyēce and cause them to incline
To charity this is my petition
For by your pac••ns and supportacyon
A little in•erlude late made and preparyd
Before your presence here shall be declaryd
¶which of a f•w conclusions is contriuyd
And point{is} of philosophy natural
But though the matt•r be not so well declaryd
As a great clerk could do nor so substantial
yet the actor hereof requiryth you all
Though he be yngnorant and ca• little skill
To regard his only intent and good will
¶which in his mind hath oft times ponderyd
what nombre of book{is} in our tongue maternal
Of joys and tryfellys be made and impryntyd
And few of th•m of matter substantial
For though m••y make book{is} yet vnneth ye shall
In our english tongue find any work{is}
Of conning that is regardyd by clerk{is}
¶The greek• th• romayns with many other mo
In their moder tongue wrote work{is} excellent
Than if clerk{is} in this r•elm• would take pain so
Considering that our tongue is now sufficient
•o expoun any hard sentence evident
•hey might if they would in our english tongue
•ryt• workys of grauyte sometime among
¶For divers pr••gnaunt wit• 〈◊〉 this land
•s well of noble men as of mean estate
〈◊〉 •othynge but •nglyshe can understand•
〈◊〉 if conning latin bokys were translate
〈◊〉 english w•l corr••t and app•obit
〈…〉 in english might be l•rnyd
〈…〉 oath•r people in their own tong{is} did
•But now so i• is that in our english tongue
〈◊〉 one th•r• is that can but rede &amp; write
〈…〉 will oft presume among
〈…〉 to compile and ballet{is} to indyte
Some o• love or other matter not worth a myte
Some to opteyn favour will flatter and gloss
Some write curious term{is} nothing to purpose
¶Thus every man after his fantasy
will write his conceit be it never so rude
Be it virtuous vicious wisdom or folly
wherefore to my purpose thus I conclude
why should not th•• the actor of this interlude
Utter his own• •antesy and conceit also
As well as divers other now a days do
¶For wis•doom• and folly is as it is takyn
For ye one called wisdom a another called folly
y•t among most folk that man is holdyn
most wise / which to be rich studyeth only
But he that for a cōmyn wealth bysyly
Studyeth and laboryth and lives by godd{is} law
Except he wax rich men count him but a daw
¶So he that is rich is ever honouryd
All though he have got it never so falsely
The pore being never so wise is reprouyd
This is the opinion most cōmynly
Thorough out the world / and yet no reason why
Therefore in my mind when that all such dawis
Have babelyd what they cā no force of .ii. straws
¶For every man in reason thus ought to do
To labour for his own necessary living
And than for the wealth of his neighbour also
But what dyuylish mind have they which musīg
And laboring all their lyff{is} do no another thing
But brīge riches to their own possession
Nothing regardīge their neighbours distrucciō
¶yet all the riches in the world that is
•ysyth of the ground by goddess sending
And by the labour of pore mennys handys
And though thou rich• mā have thereof ye keeping
y•t is not this •yches of thy getting
Nor oughtyst not in reason to be preysyd ye more
For by other mēnys labour it is got before
¶A great wytted man may soon be enrychyd
That laboryth and studyeth for riches only
But how shall his cōscyens than be discharged
For all clerk{is} affirm that that man precisely
which studyeth for his own wealth principally
Of god shall deserve but little reward
E•cept he the cōmyn wealth somewhat regard
¶So they s•y that that man occupied is
For a cōmyn wealth which is ever laboring
To rel•ue pore people with temporal goodies
And that it is a cōmyn good act to bring
People from vice and to use good living
Like wise for a cōmyn wealth occupied is he
That bryngyth them to knowledge ye yngnorāt be
¶But man to know god is a difficult
Except by a mean he him self inure
which is to know godd{is} creaturys that be
As first them that be of the grosyst nature
And than to know them that be more pure
And so by little and little ascendynge
To know godd{is} creaturys &amp; marvelous werkīge
¶And this wise man at the last shall come to
The knowledge of god and his hye mageste
And so to learn to do his dewte and also
To deser•e of his goodness partener to be
wherefore in this work d•claryd shall ye see
First of the element is the situation
And of their effectis the caul and generation
¶And though some mē thyn•e this matter to hy•
And not mete for an audience vnlernyd
Me think for man nothing more necessary
Than this to know though it be not used
Nor a matter more lowe can not be arguyd
For though the elements goddess creatures be
yet they be most gross and lowyst in degre
¶How dare men presume to be called clerk{is}
Disputing of hye creatures celestial
As things invisible and godd{is} hye warkys
And know not these visible things inferyall
So they would know hye thing{is} &amp; know nothīge at all
Of the yerth here whereon they daily be
Another the nature form nor quantyte
¶wherefore it semyth nothing convenient
A man to study and his time to be stowe
First for the knowledge of hye thing{is} excellent
And of light matters beneth nothing to know
As of these .iiij. elements here below
whose effectis daily appear here at eye
Such thīg{is} to know first / were most mete study
¶which matter before your presence shortly
In this interlude here shall be declaryd
without great eloquence ī rhyme rudely
Because the compiler is but small lernyd
This work with rethoryk is not adournyd
For perhaps in this matter much eloquence
Should make it tedious or hurt the sentence
¶But because some folk be little disposyd
To sadness / but more to mirth and sport
This philosophical work is myxyd
with merry conceits to give men cōfort
And occasion to cause them to resort
To here this matter / where if they take heed
Some learning to them thereof may {pro}cede
¶But they that shall now this matter declare
Openly here unto this audience
Be hold I prey you see where they are
The players begin to appear in presence
I se well it is time for me to go hens
And so I will do / therefore now shortly
To god I cōmyt all this hole company
THe hye mighty most excellent of all
The foūtayn of goodness verteu &amp; cōnyng
which is eterne of power most potencyall
The {per}faction and first cause of every thing
I mean that only hye na•tu•e naturing
Lo he by his goodness hath ordeynyd and create
Me here his minister called nature naturate
¶wherefore I am the verey naturate nature
The inmedyate minister for the preservation
Of every thing in his kind to endure
And cause of generation and corrupcyon
Of that thing that is brought to destruction
A another thing styll I bring forth a gain
Thus wonders•y I work and never in vain
¶The great worcester•d be hold •o deuydyd wōdersly
In to two regions whereof on I call
The ethereal region with the heuyns hye
Containing the planettys sterris &amp; speris all
The lower region called the elemental
Containing these .iiij. elements be loo
The fire the ayre the water and yerth also
¶But yet the elements and other bodies all
Beneth / take their effectys and operacyons
Of the bodies in the region ethereal
By their influence and constellacyons
They cause here corrupcyons and generacyons
For if the moving• a above should onys cease
Beneth should be another in•r•se nor decrease
¶These elements of them self so single be
Unto divers formys can not be deuydyd
yet they cōmyx to gyder daily ye s•e
whereof divers kinds of thing{is} be ingenderyd
which thing{is} eftsonys when they be corruptyd
yche element I reduce to his •urst estate
So that nothing can be utterly ad•y•helot
¶For though the form and fashion of any thing
That is a corporal body be destroyed
yet every matter remaynyth in his being
whereof it was first made and formyd
For corrupcyon of a body cōmyxyd
is but the resolution by time and space
Of every element to his own place
¶For who that will take any body corporal
And do what he can it to destroy
To break it or grind it into •ouder small
To wash to drown to bren it or to dry
yet the ayre and fire thereof •aturally
To their own {pro}per places will ascend
The water to the water the yerth to ye yerth tend
¶For if hete or moisture of any thing certain
By fire or •e water •e cons•••yd
yet yerth or ashes on yerth will remain
So the elements can never be destroyed
For essencyaliy there is now at this tide
As much fire ayre water yerth as was
Ever before this time nether more nor las
¶wherefore thou man now I speak to the
Remember that thou art compound and create
Of these elements as other creatures be
yet they have not all like noble estate
For plants and herbys grow and be insensate
Brute bestis have memory and their wit{is} five
But thou hast all those and soul intellectyue
¶So by reason of thine understanding
Thou hast dominion of other bestis all
And naturally thou sholdyst desire cōnynge
To know strange effect{is} and causys natural
Foe• he that studyeth for the life bestial
As voluptuous pleasure and bodily rest
I account him never better than a best
¶O excellent prince and great lord nature
I am thine own child and formyd instrument
I beseech thy grace take me to thy cure
And tech me such scyens thou thikyst expedyēt
¶Than sith thou art so humble and benevolent
That thing that is mete for thy capasyte
And good for thy knowledge I shall Instruct the
¶First of all thou must consider and see
These elements which do yche other penetrate
And by continual alteration they be
Of them self daily corruptyd and generate
The yerth as a point or center is situate
In the mydd{is} of the world / with ye water Joined
with the ayre &amp; fire round &amp; hole inuyronyd
¶Th• yerth of it self is ponderous and heavy
Cold and dry of his own nature {pro}per
Some part lies dry continually
And part thereof coueryd over with water
Some• with the salt see some with fresh river
which yerth and the water to gyder with all
So Ioynyd make a round figure sperycall
¶So the water which is cold &amp; moist is foūde
In and upon the y•rth filling the hole•nes
In divers partis lying with ye yerth round
yet th• hyllys and mount•yns of ye yerth excess
Take nothing of hit a way the roundness
In comparison because they be so small
No more than the prikk{is} do that be on a gall
¶The ayre which is hot and moist also
And the fire which• is ever hot and dry
A bout th• yerth and water Jointly they go
And compass them every where orbycularly
As the white a bout the yolk of an egg doth lye
But the ayre in the lower part most remaynyth
The fire naturally to the hyer tendyth
¶The eth•real region which conteynyth
The stories and planettys and •very sphere
A bout the elements daily moved
And coueryth them round a bout every where
Every sterre and sphere in strange manner
Upon his own poles mouy•h-dyuersly
which now to declare were to lunge to tarry
¶The fire and the ayre of their naturys be light
Therefore they move by natural providence
The water because it is ponderous in weight
Moved not naturally but by violence
Of the st•rris and plan•tt{is} by whose influence
The see is compellyd to ebb and flow daily
And fresh waters to spring continually
¶And though yt the water be gross and heavy
••t nothing so gross as the yerth I wis
Therefore by hete it is vaporyd up lightly
And in the ayre makyth clouds and mist{is}
But as soon as ever that it grossly is
Gender•d to gyder / it descendyth a gain
And caused upon ye yerth hail snow &amp; rain
¶The yerth because of his ponderosyte
A voydyth equally the moving{is} great
Of all extremytes and sperys that be
And •endyth to the place that is most quiet
So in the myddys of all the sperys is set
Foe•mast aby•t from all manner moving
where naturally he restyth &amp; moved nothing
¶Mark well now how I have the showed &amp; told•
Of every element the very situation
And qualyte• wherefore• this figure b•hold
For a more manifest demonstration
And by cause thou sholdyst not put to oblyu•on
My doctrine / this man called studyous desire
with the shall have con•ynuall habitation
The styll to exhort more scyens to adquire
¶For ye more yt thou desire to know any thing
Therein thou seamiest th• more a man to be
For that man that desire•th no manner cōnynge
All that while no better than a b•st is he
why ben the ey•s made but only to see
The legs to bear the body of a creature•
So •very thing is made to do his nature
¶So like wise reason wit and vnderstondyng
is give•n to the man for that thou sholdyst ī dede
Know thy maker &amp; cause of thine own being•
And what ye world is &amp; whereof thou doest {pro}cede
wherefore it be houyth the of verey need
The cause of thing{is} •urst for to learn
And than to know• &amp; laud the hye god eterne
¶O glorious lord and prince most pleasant
Greatly am I now hold•n unto the
So to illumine my mind that was yngnorant
with such noble doctrine as thou hast here showed me
wherefore I promise upon my fidelity
My diligence to do to keep in memory
And the for to honour styll {per}petually
¶And sith it hath pleasyd thy grace to admit
Me upon this man to give attendance
with thy doctrine here showed I shall qikkyn his wit
And daily put him in remembrance
His courage and desire I shall also enhance
So that his f•licit shall be most of all
To study and to search for causys natural
¶well than for a seas•n I will depart
Leuynge you to gyder here both twain
what I have shewid man prynt well in thine heart
And mark well this figure yt here shall r•mayne
whereby thou moist perceive many things more plain
••ncernynge ye matter I spake of before•
•nd when that I shall resort here a gain
Of hye point{is} of cōnynge I shall show ye more
¶Now humanyte call to your memory
The cōnynge point{is} that nature hath declaryd
And though he have showed divers poet{is} &amp; many
Of the el•mantis so wondersly formed
yet many other causys there are would be lernyd
As to know the generation of thing{is} all
Here in the yerth / how they be ingendryd
As herbys plantys well spring{is} ston and me•all
¶Those thing{is} to know for me be full expediēt
But yet ī those point{is} which nature late showed me
My mind in them as yet is not cōtent
For I can no manner wise perceive nor see
Nor prove by reason why the yerth should be
In the mydd{is} of ye firmament hengyng so small
And the yerth with the water to be roūde with all
¶Me thynkyth my self as to some of those poīt{is}
I could give a sufficient solution
For first of all thou must needs grant this
That the yerth is so deep and bottom hath non
Or else there is some gross thing hit stōdyth upon
Or else that it hangyth thou must ned{is} consent
Euyn in the mydd{is} of the firmament
¶what than go forth with thine argument
¶Thā mark well in y• day or in a winters night
The soon and moan and sterris celestial
In the est first they do apere to thy sight
〈◊〉 after in the west they do down fall
〈◊〉 again in the morrow next of all
〈◊〉 .xxiiij. hours they be come Just
To•• est poīt{is} again where thou saw them fur••
¶T•an if the earth should be of endless de•nes
Or should stand upon any other gross th••g•
It should be an impediment doubtless
To the soon moan and sterris in their moving
They should not so in the est again spring
Therefore in reason it semyth most convenient
The yerth to hang in ye mydd{is} of the fyrmamēt
¶Thine argument in ye point doth me cōfoūde
That thou hast made but yet it {pro}uytht not right
That the yerth by reason should be round
For though ye firmament with his sterris bright
Compass about the yerth eche day and night
yet the yerthe may be plain {per}aduentnre
Quadrant triangle or some other figure
¶That it can not be plain I shall well {pro}ue the
Be cause the sterris that a rise in the orient
Appear more sooner to them that there be
Than to the other dwelling in the occident
The eclipse is thereof a plain experiment
Of the soon or moan which whane it doth f•
Is never one time of the day in places all
¶yet the eclipse generally is always
In the hole world as one time being
But when we that dwell here see it in ye midday
They in the west partis see it in the morning
And they in the est behold it in the evening
And why that should so be no cause can be found
But only by reason that the yerthe is round
That reason proves the yerth at the lest
One ways to be round I cannot gain say
As for to account from the est to the west
But yet not withstondynge all that it may
Less his rowndenesse by some other way
Na no dowte yt is round every where
which I could prove thou shoudest not say nay
if I had thereto any time and leser
But I know a man called experience
Of divers instrumentys is never without
Cowed prove all these poyntys &amp; yet by his scyē•
Can tell how many mile the earth is a bout

Now would to god I had yt man now here
For the contembtacyon of my mind
¶if ye will I shall for him enquere
And bring him heder if I can him find
Then might I say ye were to me right kind
I shall assay by god that me dere bought
For cunning is the thing yt would be sought

His wife on the buttock{is} with a bear pot

I pray you be it for I am ready
No man better willing
¶Now cosyn experience as I may say ye are right welcome to this country without any feigning.
Sir I thank you thereof heartily
And I am as glad of your company
As any man living.
Sir I vnderstonde that ye have be
In many a stra•nge country
And have had great fylycyte
Strange causes to seek and find
Right far sir I have ridden &amp; gone
And seen strange things many one
In affryk / europe and inde
Both est &amp; west I have ben farr̄
North also and seen the sowth sterr̄
Both by see and land
And ben in sundry nations
with peple of divers conditions
Marvelous to vnderstonde.
Sir if a man have such courage
Or devotion in pilgrimage
Iheruzalem unto
For to account the next way
How many mile is it I you pray
From hens theder to goo
Sir as for all such questions
Of towns to know the situation
How ferr̄ they be a sunder
And other points of cosmogryfy
ye shall never learn then more surely
Then by that fugure yonder
For who that figure did first deuyse
It seems well he was wise
And perfect in this s•yens
For both these and land also
Lye true and just as they should do
I know by experience.
who think you brought here this figure
¶I wot not
¶Certes lord nature
Him self not lunge a gone
¶which was here personally
Declaring hye philosophy
And lafte this figure purposely
For humanytes instruccyon
¶Doubtless right nobly done
Sir this realm ye know is callid ēglāde
Sometime britain I vnderstonde
Therefore I prey you poīt with your hāde
In what place it should lye.
¶Sir this is ynglande lying here
And this is skotlāde yt Joins him ne'er
Compassyd a bout every where
with the occasion see round
¶And next from them westwardly
Here by him self alone doth lie
Ireland that wholesome ground
¶Here than is the narrow seey
To Calico and Boleyne the next way
And flaunders in this {per}te
Here lies france next him joining
And spayn̄ southward frō thēs stādynge
And portugal in this quart
This country is called Italy
Behold where Rome in ye mydd{is} doth lie
And Naples here be yond
And this little See that here is
Is called the Gulf of Uenys
And here venys doth stand
¶As for almayne lies this way
Here lies denmark and norway
And northward on this side
There lies Iselonde where mē do fyshe
But be yond that so cold it is
No man may there abide
¶This See is called the great Occyan
So great it is that never man
Could tell it sith the world began
Till now within this .xx. year
westward be found new lands
That we never harde tell of before this
By writing nor other means
yet many now have ben there
¶And that country is so large of rome
Much longer than all cristendome
without fable or gyle
For divers mariners have it tried
And sailed straight by the cost side
Aboue .v. thousand mile
¶But what cōmodytes be within
No man can tell nor well Imagine
But yet not lunge a go
Some men of this country went
By the kings noble consent
It for to search to that intent
And could not be brought thereto
¶But they that were they venteres
Have cause to curse their mariners
False of promise and dissemblers
That falsely them be trayed
which wold take no pain to sail farther
Than their own list and pleasure
wherefore that voyage and divers other
Such kaytyffes have destroyed
¶O what a thing had be than
if that they that be english men
Might have ben the first of all
That there should have take possession
And made first building &amp; habitation
A memory perpetual
And also what an honourable thing
Both to the realm and to the king
To have had his dominion extending•
There into so far a ground
which the noble king of late memory
The most wise prince the .vij. Harry
Caused first for to be found
¶And what a great meritorious dede
It were to have the people instructed
To live more virtuously
And to learn to know of men the manner
And also to know god their maker
which as yet live all beastly
For they another know god nor the devil
Nor never harde tell of heuyn nor hell
writing nor other scripture
But yet in the stead of god almyght
The honour the soon for his great lig•
For that doth them great pleasure
¶Building nor house they have nō at all
But wodes / cot{is} / and cauys small
No marvel though it be so
For they use no manner of iron
Another in told nor other weapon
That should help them thereto
¶Copper they have which is found
In divers places aboue the ground
yet they dig not therefore
For as I said they have non yryn
whereby they should in the yerth mine
To search for any wore
¶Great haboundauace of wot{is} there be
Most part fire and pine apple tree
Great riches might come thereby
Both pyche and tar and soap asshys
As they make in the eest lands
By brynnynge thereof only
¶Fyshe they have so great plente
That in hauyns take and slain they be
with stays withouten fail
Now frenchemen &amp; other have foūde the trade
That yearly of fyshe there they lad
A above an .C. sail
¶But in the south part of that country
The people there go nakyd always
The land is of so great he•e
And in the north part all the clothes
That they were / is but best{is} skins
They have no another fete
But howe the people first began
In that country or whens they cam
For clerks it is a question
Other things mo I have in store
That I could tel thereof but now no more
Till a another season
¶Thā at your pleasure show some other thīge
y• likes me so well your cōmynīge
ye can not talk a mys
¶Thā will I torn a gain to my matter
Of Cosmogryfy where I was err̄
Behold take heed to this
¶Loo eastward beyond ye great occyan
Here enters the see called mediterran
Of .ij.M. mile of length
The Soudans country lies here by
The great Turk on ye north side doth lie
A man of marvelous strength
¶This said north {per}te is called europe
And this south {per}te called africa
This eest {per}te is called inde
But this new land{is} found lately
Ben called america by cause only
Americus did first them find
¶Loo Ihrfin lies in this country
And this be yond is the red see
That moyses makes of mention
This quarter is India minor
And this quarter India mayor
The land of proctor Iohn̄
¶But northward this way as ye se
Many other strange regions there be
And people that we not know
But eastward on the see side
A prince there is that ruled wide
Called the Cane of catowe
¶And this is called the great eest see
which goth all a lunge this way
Towards the new landis again
But whether that see go thither directly
Or if any wilderness between them do lie
No man knows for certain
But these •ewe land{is} by all cosmography
From the cane of catous land cā not lye
Little paste a thousand mile
But from those new land{is} mē ma• •aisle plain
Eastward &amp; cū to englāde agaīe
where we began ere while
¶Lo all this part• of the yerth which I
Have here discryuyd openly
The north part we do it call
But the south {per}te on the other side
is as large as this full and as wide
which we know nothing at all
¶Nor whether y• most {per}te be land or see
Nor whether •he people that there be
Be besty••l or conning
Nor wh•th•r th•y know god or no
No• •ow• th•y believe nor what they do
Of this we know no•hynge

How that
¶Pese sir no more of this matter
Behold where humanyte cōmeth here
¶How sey you moister humanyte

That thou spikiest so hye

To come again all to supper
There as ye were to day at diner
And yet ye pointed not plain

Nor what delicate{is} ye love best
M• think you far over said
¶As for mine own {per}te I care not
Dress• what mete thou love spare not
what so ever thou doest best think
¶Now if ye put it to my liberty
Of all met{is} in the world that be
By this light I love best drink
¶It semyth by thy face so to do
But my moister will have mete also

¶By god sir than ye must tell what
At thy discretion I force not

For I may tell you in pryuyte
Hit was brewed but yester night

¶But than I have for your appetite
A cup of wine of old claret
There is no better by this light

As good as ever you put to your nose
For there is a •eyre wench called rose
Dystylleth a quart every day
By god I would a pynt of that

Before all this presence
¶yet I had lever she and I
where both to gyther secretly
In some corner in the spence
For by god it is a pretty girl
It is a world to se her whirl
Dancing in a round
O lord god how she will trip
She will bounce it she will whip

¶well let all such matters pass I sey
And get the hens and goo thy way
About this other matter

That I spake of before
¶Experience why is this he
Sir ye are right welcome unto me
And shall be ever more
¶Sir I thank you thereof heartily
But I assure you faithfully
I have small courage here to tarry
As lunge as this man is here
¶why whoreson what eylyst at me
¶For thou hast ever so lewd a {pro}perte
Science to despise and yet thou art he
That nought can nor nought will lere
¶Mary auaūt knave I make god avow
I think my self as cōnynge as thou
And that shall I prove shortly
I shall put the a question now come ne'er
Let me se how well thou can answer
How spellest this word tom Couper
In true a•tografye
¶Tom co•per quoth a a wise qu•styō herdly

Lo he hath for gotten ye may se
The first word of his a b c.
Hark foal hark I will tech the
P. a. pa. t. •. r. •er. do to gyther tom couper
is not this a sore matter
Loo here ye may se him {pro}uyd a foal
He had more need to go to scole
Than to come hither to clatter
¶Certain this is a solution
Mete for such a boys question
¶Sensual appetite I prey the
Let pass all such trifles and vanyte
For a wy•e it shall not lunge be
And depart I the require
For I would talk a word or two
with this man here or he hens go
For to satisfy my desire
¶why goggis soul will ye so shortly
Break poyntment with yonder company
where ye should come to supper
I trust ye will not break {pro}mys so
¶I care not greatly if I do
yt is but a tavern matter
¶Than will I go show them what ye sey
¶Spare not if thou will go thy way
For I will here tarry
¶Thā a dew for a while I tel you plain
But I {pro}myse you whā I come a gain
I shall make yonder knauys twain
To repent and be sorry
¶Now I am full glad that he is gone
¶So am I for good will he do none
To no man living
But this is the man with whom ye shall
I trust be well content with all
And glad of his cōmynge
¶For he hath expownyd cunningly
Divers points of Cosmogryfy
In few words and short clause
¶So I understand he hath god science
And that he hath by plain ex{per}ience
Lernyd many a strange cause
¶ye sir and I say for my {per}te
He is the cōnyngest man in that art
That ever I could find
For ask what question ye will do
Howe the yerth is round or other mo
He will satisfy your mind
¶why what dout have ye therein found
Think ye the yerth should not be round
Or else howe suppose ye
¶One way it is round I must consent
For this man provide it evident
Toward the eest and occident
It must nedis round be
¶And likewise from the south to north
That point to prove were sū thāke worth
¶yes that I can well prove
For this ye know as well as I
ye se the north star in the sky
Mark well ye shall vnethe it spy
That ever it doth remove
¶But this I assure you if you go
Northward an hundredth mile or two
ye shall think it rises
And how that it is ne'er approached
The point over the top of your head
which is called your zenith
¶yet if ye go the other way
Southward .x. or .xii. days Journey
ye shall then think anon
It descend and come more ny
The sercle {per}tynge the yerth and sky
As ye loke straight with your eye
which is called your oryson
¶But ye may go southward so far
That at the last that same star
will seem so far down right
Clear under neth your oryson
That sight thereof can you have non
The yerth will stop your sight
¶This {pro}uyth of necessity
That the yerth must nedis round be
This conclulsyon doth it try
¶Now that is the {pro}perist conclusion
That ever I herd for by reason
No man may hit deuye
But sir if that aman sail far
Upon the see will than that star
Do there as on the ground
¶ye doubtless sail• northward rise it will
And sail southward it falls still
And that provide the see round
¶So doth it in mine opinion
But know you any other conclusion
To prove it round save that alone
¶ye that I know right well
As thus mark well when y• see is clear
That no storm nor wawe therō doth pere
This mariners can tell
¶Than if a fire be made on night
Upon the shore that gives great light
And a ship in the see far
They in the top the fire se shall
And they on hash nothing at all
yet they on haches be nerr̄
¶Also on the see where men be sailing
Far from land they se nothing
But the water and the sky
yet when they draw the land more ne'er
Than the hill tops begin to apere
Styll the ne'er more hye and hye
As though they were styll growing fast
Out of the see till at last
when they come the shore to
They se the hill top foot and all
which thing so could not be fall
But the see lay round also
Me thinks your argumēt sōwhat hard
¶Than ye shall have it more plainly declared
If ye •aue great desire
For here loo by mine instruments
I can show the plain ex{per}iment{is}
¶Thereto I you require
¶with all my heart it shall be done
But for the first conclusion
That I spake of the fire
Be this the s•ey that is so round
And this the fire upon the ground
And this the ship that is here
ye know well that a man sight
Can never be but in a lyne right
¶Just you say that is clear
¶Mark well than may not yt mānis eye
¶with argyng here their foe•y••• 〈◊〉
That is not worth iij. straws
¶I love not this horizon losophers
Nor this great cōnyng extromers
That tell how far it is to the sterres
I hate all manner conning
I would ye knew it I am Ignorance
A lord I am of gretter pusans
Than the king of yngland or france
ye the grittiest lord living
¶I have seruaūt{is} at my retynew
That lunge to me I assure you
Here with in ynglande
That with me yngnorance dwell styll
And term of life cōtynew will
A above v C. thousand
Gog{is} naylys I have payed sō of thē I trow
why man what eylyth y• so to blow
For I was at a shrewd fray
Hast thou any of them slain than
ye I have slain them every man
Save them that ran away
why is any of them skapyd &amp; gone
ye by gog{is} body euerychone
All that ever were there
O sir ye know right well this
That when any man is
In other men's company
He must ned{is} follow the appyte
Of such thing{is} as they delight
Some time among party
But such knaves wold always have y•
To put all thy mind &amp; felicity
In this foolish cōnyng to study
which if thou do will make ye mad
And always to be pensive &amp; sad
Thou shalt never be merry
Merry quote a / no I make god avow
But I pray ye master hark on word now
And answer this thing
whether thought you it better chere
At the tavern where we were ere
Or ell{is} to clatter with these knaves here
Of their foolish cunning
Nay I can not say the contrary
But y• I had much myryer company
At the tauer•e than in this place
Than if ye have any wit or brain
Let vs go to the tavern again
And make some merry solace
if he will do so thā doth he wisely
By my troth I care not greatly
For I am indifferent to all company
whether it be here or there
Then I shall tell you what we will do
Master yngnorans you &amp; he also
Shall tarry both styll here
And I will go fet hither a cōpany
That ye shall here thē sing as swetly
As they were angel{is} clear
¶And yet I shall bring hydyr a another sort
Of lustily blood{is} to make disport
That shall both dance &amp; spring
And torn clean aboue ye ground
with fryscas &amp; with gambawd{is} round
That all the hall shall ring
¶And yt done with in an hour or twain
I shall at the town again
Prepare for you a banquet
Of metys that be most delicate
And most pleasant drink{is} &amp; wynes there ate
That is possible to get
•which shall be in a chamber fair
Replete with sot &amp; fragrāt eyre
Preparyd point deuyse
with damask water made so well
That all y• hows thereof shall smell
As it were parties
¶And after that if ye will touche
A fair wench nakyd in a couch
Of a soft bed of down
For to satisfy your wantō lust
I shall appoint you a trull of trust
Not a fairer in this town
¶And when ye have taken your delight
And thus satisfied the appetite
Of your wits five
ye may sey than I am a servant
For you so necessary and pleasant
I trow non such a live
¶Now by the way that god did walk
It cōforthe mine heart to here the talk
Thy mache was never seyn
¶Than go thy way by and by
And bring in this company
And he and I will here tarry
Till thou come again
¶And I prey the heartily also
¶At your request so shall I do
Lo I am gone now fare well
I shall bring them in to this hall
And come my self foremost of all
And of these revels be ch•fe mershall
And order all thing well
¶Now set thy heart on a merry pyn
Agayns these lusty blood{is} come in
And drive fantasies a way
And so I will by heuyn king
If they other dance or singe
Have a monge them by this day
¶Than thou takyst good &amp; wise ways
And so shalt thou best please
All this hole company
For the foolish arguing yt thou hast had
with that knave experience yt hath made
All these folk thereof weary
¶For all they that be now in this hall
They be the most {per}te my servant{is} all
And love principally
Disports as dancing syngyuge
Toys tryfuls laughing jesting
For conning they set not by
I se well such company ever more
As sensual appetite is gone fore
will please well this audience

Dowt not we shall have good sport
