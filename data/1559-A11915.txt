WHo so in pomp of proud estate,
or kingdom sets delight:
Or who that joys in princes court
to bear the sway of might.
No dredes the fates which from aboue
the wavering gods down flings:
But fast affiance fixed hath,
in frail and fickle things:
Let him in me both see the face,
of fortunes flattering joy:
And eke respect the ruthful end,
of the (O rumons Troye)
For never gave she plainer proof,
then this ye present se:
How frail and brittle is thestate,
of pride and high degre.
The flower of flowering Asia, lo•
whose fame the heavens resound,
The worthy work of gods aboue,
is batered down to ground.
And whose assautes they sought afar,
from west with banners spread,
where Tanais cold her branches seven.
abroad the world doth shed.
With huge host and from the east,
where springes the newest dea,
Where Luke warm Tygris channel runs,
and metes the ruddy sea.
And which from wandering land of Scythe,
the band of widows sought:
With fire and sword thus battered be,
her turrets down to nought.
The walls but late of high renown.
lot here their rumous fall:
The buildings burn and flashing flame,
swepes through the palace all.
Thus every house full hye it smokes,
of old •ssara•lls land:
No yet the ••am withholds from spoil.
the gredo victors hand.
The surging smoke the asure sky,
and light hath hid away:
And (as with cloud beset) troys as∣shes
stains the dusky day.
Through appears with ire and greedy of hart,
the victor from a far.
Doth view the long assauted Troy,
the gain or ten years war.
And eke the miseries thereof,
abhors to look upon,
An though he see it yet scant himself•
beleues it might be won,
The spoils thereof with greedy hand.
they snatch and bear away:
A thousand ships would not receive
a board: so huge a pray.
The prefull might I doe protest,
of gods adverse to me,
My contries dust, and Trojan king,
I call to witness thee.
Whom Troy now hides and underneath
the stones, art over trod:
With all the gods that guide thy ghost,
and Troy that lately stood.
And you also yt flocking ghosts,
of all my children dere:
Ye lesser sprightes: what ever ill,
hath happened to vs here.
What ever Phebus waterishe •ace,
in fury hath foresaid:
At raging rise from seas, when erst,
the monstres had him frayed.
In childbed bands I saw it yore,
and wist it should be so:
And I in vain before Cassan∣dra
told it long ago.
Not false Ulysses kindled hath
these fires, nor none of his:
Not yet deceitful Sinons craft,
that hath bin cause of this.
My fire it is wherewith ye burn,
and Parys is the brand:
That smoketh in thy towers (O Troy)
the flower of Phrygian land.
But ay alas unhappy age,
why dost thou yet so sore,
Bewail thy contries fatal fall.
thou knew it long before.
Behold thy last cala•tte•,
and them bewail with tears:
Account as old Troys overturn•
and past by many years.
I saw the slaughter of the king;
and how he lost his life:
By thawlters side (more mischief was)
with stroke of Pyrrhus knife.
When in his hand he wound his lockes.
and drew the king to ground:
And hid to hilts his wicked sword,
in deep and deadly wound.
Which when the gored king had toke,
as willing to be slain,
Out of the old mans throat he drew.
his bloody blade again.
Not pity of his years, alas,
in mans extremest age:
From slaughter might his hand withhold,
no yet his ire assuage.
The gods are witness of the same
and eke the sacrifies,
That in his kingdom holden was,
that flat on ground now lies.
The father of so many kings
Pryam of ancient name,
Untombed lies and wants in blase
of Troy: his funeral flame.
No yet the gods are wreaked, but lo•
his sons and daughters all,
Such lords they serve as doth by chance
of lot, to them befall.
Whom shall I follow now for pray?
or where shall I be led?
There is perhaps among the greeks,
that Hectors wife will wed.
Some man desires Helenus spouse
some would Antenors have,
And in the greeks there wants not some
that would Cassandra crave.
But I alas most woeful wight,
whom no man seeks to choose,
I am the only refuge left,
and me they clean re•use,
Ye careful captive company
why stints your woeful cry?
Bea•e on your breasts and piteously
complain with voice so hye,
As mete may be for Troys estate,
let your complaints rebound
In tops of treese: and cause the hills,
to ring with terrible sound.
NOt folk v•apt, nor new to weep (o Queen•)
thou wilst to whale, by practise are we taught
For all these years, in such case have we been
since first the Trojan guest, &amp; my clas sought•
Ana saylde the seas, that led him on his way
with sacred ship, to Cibell dedicate
From whence he brought, his vnrepyning pray,
the ••use alas, of all this dire debate
Ten times now hid, the hills of Id•y bee,
with snow of silver hew, all over laid.
And bared is for Trojan roges eche tree,
ten times in field, the harvest man afraid,
The spikes of corn hath reaped, since never day
his wailing wants, new cause renews our w•.
Lift up thy hand, (o Queen) cry well away:
we follow thee, we are well taught thereto.
Ye faithful fellows of your casualty
Untie that tyre, that on your heads ye wear,
And as behooves state of misery,
let fall about your woeful necks. your hear.
In dust of Troy, rub al your arms about.
in slacker wed, and let your breasts •e tide
Down to your bellies, let your limbs lye out,
for what wedlock should you your bosoms hyde?
Your garments loose, and have in readiness
your furious hands, upon your breasts to knock
This habit well besemeth our distress
it pleases me, I know the Trojan flock
Renew again your long accustomed cries
and more then erst, lament your miseries.
We bewail Hector.
¶Our hear we have untied, now every chon•
All rent for sorrows of our cursed cac•
our lockes out spreads• the knots we have undone
And in these ashes slain is our face.
¶Fill up your hands &amp; make thereof no spare•
for this yet lawful is, from Troy to take,
Let down your garments from your shoulders bare
and suffer not your clamour so to slake.
Your naked breasts wait for your hands to smight
now dolor deep, now sorrow, show thy might
Make al the coasts that compass Troy about
witness the sound, of all your careful cry
Cause from the caves, the Echo to cast out
Rebounding voice of al your misery:
not as she wontes, the latter word to sound
But al your woe, from far let it rebound
Let al the seas it hear, and eke the land
Spare not your breasts with heavy stroke to strike
beat ye your selves, eche one with cruel hand
For yet your wonted cry doth me not like
We bewail Hector.
¶Our naked arms, thus here we rent for thee,
and bluddy shoulders, (Hector) thus we tear:
Thus with our fistes, our heads lo beaten be
and al for there, behold we hale our hear.
Our dugs alas, with mothers hands be torn
and where the flesh is wounded round about
Which for thy sake, we rent thy death to morn
the flowing streams of blud, they spring therout,
Thy countries shore, and destined delay,
and thou to wearied Troians wast an aid.
A wall thou wast, and on thy shoulders Troy
ten years it stood: on thee alone it stayde,
With thee it fell: and fatal day alas
of Hector both, and Troy but one there was.
¶Enough hath hector: turn your plaint &amp; moan
and shed your tears for Pryame every chone.
¶Receive our plaints, O lord of Phrigian land,
and old twice captive king, receive our fear,
While thou were king, Troy hurtles then could stand
though shaken twice, with Grecian sword it wear,
And twice did shot of Hercles quiver bear:
at latter los of Hecubes sons all
and roges for kings, that high on piles we rear:
thou father shu•st our latest funeral.
And beaten down, to Jove for sacrifies.
like liveless, block, in Troye thy carcass lies.
¶Yet turn ye once your treares, another way,
my Pryames death, should not lamented be
O Troianes all, full happy is Pryame say,
for free from bondage, down descended he,
To the lowest ghosts: and never shall sustain
his captive neck, with Greeks to yoked be
He never shall, behold the Atrides twain
nor false Ulysses ever shall he see,
Not he a pray, for Greeks to triumph at
his neck shall subject, to their conquests bear
No give his hands, to tie behind his back
that to the rule of scepters wonted wear
Nor following Agamemnons chart, in band
shall he be pomp, to proud Mycenas land.
¶Full happy Pryame is, eche one we say
that took with him his kingdom, then that stood
Now safe in shade, he seeks the wandering way
and treads the paths of all Elizius wood,
And in the blessed sprites, full happy he,
again there seeks, to mete with Hectors ghost,
Happy Pryame, happy who so may see,
his kingdom all, at ones with him be lost.
O Ye to whom, the lord of land and seas,
of life and death, hath grafited here the power
Lay down your lofty looks, your pride app•as
the crowned king, flees not his fatal hour.
Who so thou be, that leadst thy land alone
thy life was limit, from thy mothers womb,
Not purple robe, not glorious glittering throne,
no crown of gold, redemes the from the tomb
A king he was, that waiting for the veil,
of him that slew, the Minotaure in fight.
Begylde with blackens, of the wonted sail
in seas him sonke, and of his name they hight.
So he that wilde, to win the golden spoil
and first with ship, by seas to seek renown,
In lesser wave, at length to death began boyle,
and thus the daughters, brought their father down•
Whose songs, the woods hath drawn, and rivers held.
and birds to hear his notes, did theirs forsake,
In piece meal thrown, amid the Thracian field,
without return hath sought the Stigian lake.
They sit aboue, that hold our life in line,
and what we suffer, down they fling from hye
No cark, no care, that ever may untwine
the thirds, that woven are aboue the sky,
As witnessed he, that sometime king of Greece,
had Iason thought, in drenching sees to drown
who escaped both death, and gained the golden fleece,
whom sates advance, there may no power pluck down
The highest god, sometime that Saturn hight
his fall him taught to credit their decries
The rule of heavens: he lost it by their might
and Jove his son, now turns the rolling skies.
Who weans here to win eternal wealth,
let him behold this present perfect proof,
And learn, the secrete steppe, of chances stelth,
most ne'er alas, when most it seems aloof.
In slipper joy, let no man put his trust
let none despair, that heavy hippos hath past
The sweet with sour, she mingles as she lust
whose doubtful web, pretends nought to last.
Frailty is the third, that Clothoes rock hath spoon
now from the distaff dr•wne, now knapt in twain
With al the world, at length his end he won,
whose works have wrought, his name shoal great remain
and he, whose travels, twelve, his name display,
that feared nought, the force of worldly hue•t,
In fine alas hath found his fatal day,
and dyed with smart of Dianyra•s shirt,
If prowes might eternity procure,
then Pryame yet should live in liking lust
•y portly pomp of pride, thou art unsure
•o learn by him, o lunges ye are but dust.
and Hecuba that waileth now in care,
that was so late of high estate a Queen
a mirror is, to teach you what you are
your wavering wealth, o princes, here is seen.
Whom dawn of day, hath seen in high estate
before sons set, alas hath had his fall
The cradles rock, appoints the life his date
from settled joy, to sudden funeral.
FOrsaking now the places tenebrous,
and deep dens of thinfernal region
from all the shadows of •listous
That wander there the paths full many on•.
Lo, here am I returned all alone.
The same Achill whose fierce and heavy hand
Of all the world, no wight might yet withstand.
What man so stout of all the Gracious host.
That hath not sometime craved Achilles aide,
and in the Troians, who of prowes most
That hath not feared to see my banners splayde
Achilles lo, hath made them all afraid.
and in the Greeks hath been a pillar post,
That sturdy stood against there Toiane host.
Where I have lackte, the Gracious went to wrack
Troy hath proud what Achilles sword could do
Where I have come the Troianes fled a back,
Retiring fast from field their walls unto,
No man that might Achilles stroke fordo,
I dealt such stripes amid the Trojan route,
That with their blood I stained the fields about.
Mighty Memnon, that with his Persian band,
Would Pryames part with all his might maintain•
Lo now he lythe and knows Achilles hand
amid the field is Troylus also slain.
Ye Hector gr•at, whom Troy accounted plain
The flower of chivalry that might be found,
all of Achilles had their mortal wound,
But Paris lo, such was his false disceite,
Pretending marriage of Polyxeine,
Behind the alter lay for me in wait
Where I unawares have fallen into the train
And in Appolloes church he hath me slain
Whereof the bell will now just vengeance have,
And here again, I come my right to crave.
The deep Auerne my rage may not sustain
Nor bear the angers of Achilles spright
From Acheront, I rent the soil in twain
and through the ground, I grant• again to sight
Hell could not hide Achilles from the light,
Vengeance and blood doth Orcus pit require,
To quench the furies of Achilles ire.
The hateful land• that worse then Tartar• is
and burning thrust excites of Tantalus,
I here behold again, and Troye is this
O, travel worse, th•n slon• of Sisyphus
and pains that pass the pangs of Tityus
To light more loathsome surie hath me sent
Then hooked whele, that I•ions flesh doth rent.
Remembered is allow where spretes do dwell
The wicked slaughter wrought by wily way,
Not yet revenged hath the depest hell,
Achilles blood on them that did him slay
But now of vengeance comes the ireful day
and darkest dens of Tartare from beneath
Conspire the fates: of them that wrought my death.
Now mischief, murder, wrath of hell drawth ne'er
and dire Phlegethon flood doth blood require
Achilles death shall be revenged here
With slaughter such as Stygian lakes desire
Her daughters blood shall slake the sprites ire,
Whose son we slew. whereof doth yet remain,
The wrath beneath, and hell shall be their payne.
From burning lakes the furies wrath I threat,
and syer that nought but streams of blood may slake
The rage of wind and seas these ships shall beat,
and Ditis deep on you shall vengeance take,
The sprites cry out, the earth and seas do quake
The poole of Styx, ungrateful Greeks it seath,
With slaughtered blood revenge Achilles death.
The soil doth shake to bear my heavy foot
and fearth again the sceptours of my hand
The pools with stroke of thunderclap ring out
The doubtful stars amid their course do stand,
and fearful Phebus hides his blazing brand.
The trembling lakes against their course do slyte,
For dread and terrur of Achilles spryte.
Great is the ransom, ought of dew to me,
Wherewith yt must the sprites, and hell appease,
Polyxena shall sacrificed be,
Upon my tomb, their yreful wrath to please,
and with her blood, ye shall assuage the seas
Your ships may not return to Greece again
Till on my tomb Polyxena be slain.
And for that she should then have been my while,
I will that Pyrrhus render her to me,
and in such solemn sort byreeue her life,
as ye are wont the weddings for to see,
So shall the wrath of hell appeased be,
Nought else but this may satisfy our ire,
Her will I have, and her I you require.
ALas how long the lingering greeks
in heaven do make delay,
When either war by seas they seek
or home to pas their way.
¶Why show what cause doth hold your ships
and Grecian navy stays,
Declare if any of the gods
have stopped your homeward ways.
¶My mind is masde my trembling 〈◊〉
quake and are afeared,
For stranger news of truth then these
I think were never heard.
Lo I my self have plainly seen,
in dawning of the day,
When Phebus first began to approach,
and drive the stars away.
The earth all shaken suddenly
and from the hollow ground,
My thought I heard with roaring cry
a deep and dreadful sound.
That shoke the woods and all the treese
rong out with thunder stroke,
From Ida hills down fell the stones
the mountain tops were broke.
and not the earth hath only quake•e
but all the sea likewise,
Achilles presence felt and knew
and high the surges rise.
The cloven ground Erebus pitts
then showed and depest dens,
That down to Gods that guide beneath,
the way appeared from hence.
Then shoke the tomb from whence anon
in flame of fury light,
appears from the hollow canes
Achilles noble spright.
as wonted he his Thracian arms
and banners to disploye
and weld his weighty weapons well,
against thassautes of Troye.
The same Achilles seemed he than
that he was wont to be
amid the hostess, and casely could
I know, that this was he.
With carcass slain in furious fight
that stopped and filed eche flood,
and who by slaughter of his hand
made Xanthus run with blood
as when in chariot high he sate
with lofty stomach stought.
While Hector both and Troy at once
he drew the walls abought.
aloud he cried and every coast,
rang with Achilles sound
and thus with hollow voice he spake.
from bottom of the ground.
The greeks shall not with little price
redeem Achilles ire,
A princely ransom must they give,
for so the fates require.
Unto my ashes Polyxene,
spoused shall here be slain,
By Pyrrhus hand, and all my tomb
her blood shall ouerstayn•.
This said, he straight sank down again
to Plutoes deep region,
The earth then closed the hollow caves
were vanished and gone.
Therewith the whether waxed clear,
the raging winds did slake,
The tombling seas began to rest,
and al the tempest brake.
WHat time our sails we should have spread,
upon Sygeon seas,
With swift return from long delay,
to seek our homeward ways.
Achilles rose whose only hand,
hath given greeks the spoil.
Of Troia sore annoyed by him
and leveled with the soil.
With speed requighting his abode
and former long delay,
At Scyros i'll• and Lesbos both•
amid the Egeon sea.
Till he came here in doubt it stood,
of fall or sure estate
Then though ye hast to grant his will
ye shall it give to late.
Now have the other captains all,
the price of their manhood,
What else reward for his prowes,
then her all only blood?
Are his deserts think you but light,
that when he might have fled,
And passing Pelyus years in peace,
a quiet life have led.
Detected yet his mothers crafts,
forsook his women's wed•
And with his weapons proved himself,
a manly man in dede?
The king of Mysya Telephus
that would the greeks withstand•
Coming to Troy forbidding vs,
the passage of his land.
To late repenting to have felt,
Achilles heavy stroke,
Was glad to crave his health again•
where he his hurt had toke.
For when his sore might not be salved
as told Appollo plain,
Except the spear that gave the hurt
restored help again.
Achilles plasters cured his cuts
and saved the king alive
His hand both might and mercy knew
to s•ay and then revive.
When Thebes fell: •etion saw it
and might it not withstand.
The captive king could nought redress
the ruin of his land.
Lyrnesus little likewise felt
his hand and down it fill,
With rum overturned like
from top of haughty hill.
and taken Brys•is land it is
and prisoner is she caught
The cause of strife between the kings
is Chryses come to n•ught.
Tenedos yle well known by fame
and fertile soil he took
That sostreth •att the Thracian flocks
and sacred •isle shook.
What boots to blase the brute of him
whom tromp of fame doth show•
Through all the coasts where C•icus flood
with swelling stream doth flow•
The ruthful ruin of these realms
so many towns bett down.
another man would glory count
and worthy great renown.
But thus my father made his way
and these his journeys are,
And battles many one he sought.
while war he doth prepare.
As wished I may his merits more
shall yet not this remain.
Well known and counted praise enough•
that he hath Hector slain?
During whole life the Gracious all
might never take the town
My father only vanquished Troy•
and you have plus•• it down,
Rejoice I may your parents praise
and brute abroad his acts
It seems the soon to follow well
his noble fathers act•.
In sight of Pryame Hector slain
and Memnon both they lay.
With heavy cheer hi• parents wait••
to morn his dying day.
Himself abhorde his handy works
in •ight that had them slain
The sons of Goddess I chilles knew•
were borne to dye again.
The woman Queen of Amazons
that grandee the Greeks full sore
Is turned to flight then ceased out fear
we drade their bows no more.
If ye well way his worthiness
Achilles ought to have
Though he from Argos or Mice∣nas
would a virgin crave.
Doubt ye herein? allow ye not
that straight his will be done.
And count ye cruel Pryanies blood
to give to Peleus son?
For Helens sake your own childes blood,
appeasde Dyanaes ire,
• wonted thing and done ere this,
it is that I require.
¶The only fault of youth it is
not to refrain his rage•
The fathers blood already stirs,
in Pryames wanton age
Sometime Achilles grieuo•s checks
I bare with patient hart,
The more thou may the more thou oughtf•e,
to suffer in good part.
Whereto would ye with slaughtered blood
a noble spirit slain?
Think what is mete the greeks to doo
and troians to sustain.
The proud estate of tiranye
may never long endure.
The king that rules with modest mean•
of safety may be sure.
The higher steppe of princely state
that fortune hath vs synde,
The more behouthe a happy man
humility of mind.
And dread the change that chau•ce may bring
whose gifts so soon be los•e
And chiefly then to fear the gods,
while they the favour most.
In beating down that w•rr• hath 〈◊〉,
by proof I have ben taught,
What pomp• and pride, in twinke of Iye,
may fall and come to nought.
Troye made me fire• and proud of mind,
Troy makes me frayed with all:
The Greeks now stand where Troy ••te fell,
eche thing may have his fall.
Sometime I grau•• I did my self,
and sceptors proudly beat,
The thing that might advance my heart•
makes me the more to fear.
Thou Priame perfect proof presen•st.
thou art to me eftsoon:
A cause of pride, a glass of f••re,
a mirror for the nones.
Should I account the sceptors ought,
but glorious vanity?
Much like the borrowed braided here,
the face to beautify.
One sudden chance may turn to nought.
and maim the might of men,
With fewer then a thousand ships,
and years in les then ten.
Not she that guides the, slipper whel•,
of fate: doth so delay:
That she to all possession grants,
of ten years settled staye.
With leave of Greec• I will confess,
I would have wo•no the town,
But not with ruin thus 〈◊〉,
to se it beaten down•
But lo the battle made by night
and rage of fervent mind,
Could not abide the brideling bit
that reason had assinde.
The happy sword once stained with blood
unsociable is,
And in the dark the fervent rage
doth strike the more amiss.
Now are we wreak on Troy to much
let all that may remain.
A virgin borne of princes blood
for offering to be slain
And given be, to stain the tom•e
and ashes of the ded,
And under name of wedlock se
the guiltless blood be shed,
I will not grant: for mine should bee
thereof both fault and blame,
Who when he may forbids not
offence: doth will the same.
¶And shall his sprightes have no rewar••
their angers to appayse?
Ye• very great, for all the world•
shall celebrate his praise.
And lands unknown that never s•w
the man so praised by fame,
Shall here and keep• for many years,
the glory of his name.
If bloodshed veil his ashes ought
strike of an ox• head.
And let no blood that may be cause
of mothers tears be shed
What furious fran•ye may this be
that doth your will so lead,
This earnest careful suit to make
in travail for the dead?
Let not such envy toward your fa∣there
in your hart remain,
That for his sacrifice ye would
procure an others payne.
¶ Proud tyrant while prosperity•
thy stomach doth advance,
And cowardly wretch that shrinks for fer•
in case of fearful chance.
Is yet again thy breast inflamed,
with brand of venus might?
Wilt thou alone so oft deprive
A chilles of his right?
This hand shall give the sacrifice
the which if thou withstand.
A greater slaughter shall I make,
and worthy Pyrrhus hand.
And now to long from princes slaugh∣la
doth my hand abide,
And meet it were that Poly•eine
were laid by Priames side.
I nought deny but Pyrrhus chief
renown: in war is this,
That Priam slain with cruel sword,
to your father humbled is.
¶My fathers foes we have them known,
submit themselves humbly,
And Pryam presently ye wot,

But tho• for fear not stout to rule,

While thou to Aiax and vlis∣ses,

¶But needs I must and will confess
your father did not fear:
When burnt our fleet with Hectors brands,
and Greeks they slaughtered weate,
While loitering then a aloof he lay,
unmindful of the •ight.
In stead of arms with scratch of quill,
his sounding harp to smight.
¶ Great Hector then despising the
Achilles songs did fear:
And thessale ships in greatest dread,
in quiet peace yet wear.
¶ For why aloof the thessale fleet•
they lay from Trow•ans hands,
And well your father might have rest,
he felt not Hectors brands,
¶Well seems a noble king to give

¶Wh•e hast thou then a worthy king

¶But now your mercy moves you

I will thereto agree.
Calchas whose counsel ruled our ships,

Unlokst the po•le and hast by art,

To whom the bowels of the beast,
to whom the thunder clap,
And blas•ng star with flaming train,
betokened what shall ha•.
Whose words with decreased price I bought,
now tell vs by what mean,
The will of Gods agrees that we
return to Greece again.
¶The fates apoint the Greeks to bye
their wale• with wonted price.
And with what cost ye came to Troy,
ye shall repair to Greece
With blood ye came, with blood ye must,
from hence return again,
And where Achilles ashes lies,
the virgin shall be slain,
In ••mely sort of habit• such
as maidens wont ye se,
Of Thessalie, or Myeen•s else,
what time they wedded be.
With Pyrrhus hand she shall be slain,
of right it shall be so.
And meet it is that he the so•no,
his fathers right should do.
But not this only stays our ships,
our sails may not be spread,
Before a worthier blood then thine,
(Pol••ena) be shed.
which thirst the fates, for •ri•mes no∣phew,
Hectors little boy:
The greeks shall tumble headlong down,
from highest tower in Troy.
Let him there die, this only way
ye shall the gods appease,
Then spread your thousand sails with joy,
ye need not fear the seas.
MAy this be true or doth the fable fain,
When corps is dead the sprite to live as yet•
when death our ties with heavy hand doth strain
And fatal day our looms of light hath shet,
And in the tomb, our ashes once be set,
Hath not the soul likewise his funeral,
But still alas do wretches live in thrall?
Or else doth all at once together dye•
And may no part his fatal hour delay.
But with the breath the soul from hence doth fly•
Amid the clouds to vanish quite away,
As dinky shade fires from the yon•• by day?
And may no jot escape from destiny,
When once the brand hath burned the body?
What ever then the rise of some may see,
And what the west that sets the son doth know,
In all Neptunus reign what ever bee,
That restless seas doe wash and over flow,
with purple waives still tombling to and fro.
Age shall consume: eche thing that liuthe sh•ll die,
With swifter race then Pegasus doth fly.
And with what whirl, the twice six signs do fly,
With course as swift, as rectoure of the spheres,
Doth guide those glistering globes eternally,
And Hecate her changed horns repairs,
So drauthe on death, and life of eche thing wears,
And never may the man, return to sight,
That once hath fell• the stroke of Parses might.
For as the fume that from the fire doth pas,
With turn of hand, doth vanish out of sight
And swifter then the northern bores,
With whirling blast and storm of raging might,
Driuthe far away and puts the clouds to flight,
So flees the spright that rules our life away,
And nothing tarries after dying day.
Swift is the race we run, at hand the mark,
Lay down your hope, that weight here ought to wy•.
And who dredes ought, cast of thy careful cark,
Wilt thou it wot what state thou shalt be in,
When dead thou art? as thou had never bin.
For greedy time it doth devour vs all,
The world it sways to Chaos heap to fall.
Death-hurtes the corps and spares not the spright,
And as for all the dens of Tenor deep,
With Cerberus kingdom dark that knows no light,
And straightest gates that he there sits to keep,
They fancies are, that follow folk by slept
Such rumours vain, but feigned lies they are,
And fables, like the dreams in heavy care.
O dreadful day: alas the sorry time,
Is come of all the mothers ruthful wo,
Istranax, alas thy fatal line,
Of life is worn, to death straight shalt thou go,
The sisters have decreed it should be so,
There may no force alas escape their hand,
The mighty Jove their will may not withstand.
To see the mother, her tender child forsake.
What gentle hart that may from tears reframe,
Or who so fierce that would not pity take,
To see alas the gilties infant slain.
For sorry hart the tears mine •yes do stain,
To think what sorrow shall her hart oppress,
Her little child to leese remediless,
The double cares of Hectors wife to whale,
Good Ladies have your tears in reddens,
And you with whom should pity most prevail.
Rue on her grief: bewail her heaviness.
With sobbing hart, lament her deep distress
When she with tears• shall take leave of her soon,
And now (good ladies) here what shall be done.
ALas ye careful company
why hal• ye thus your hears?
Why beat you so your boiling br•stes
and stain your eyes with tears?
The fall of Troy is new to you
but unto me not so,
I have foresene this careful case
ere this time long ago
When fierce Achilles Hector slew
and drew the corps abought
Then then me thought I wist it well,
that Troy should come to nought.
In sorrows sonke, I senseless am
and wrapped alas in woe,
But soon except this babe me held,
to Hector would I go.
This seely soole my stomach tames
amid my misery,
And in the hour of heaviest hippos,
permits me not to dye,
This only cause constraynth 〈◊〉 yet
the Gods for him to pray,
with tracked of time prolonges my payne,
delays my dying day.
He takes fro me the lack of fear
the only fruit of ill.
For while he lives yet have I left
whereof to fear me styll.
No place is left for better chance,
with worse we are oppressed:
To scare alas and se no hope,
is worst of all the rest.
¶What sudden fear thus moves your mind,
and vexes you so sore?
¶Still still alas of one mishap
there rises more a•d more.
Not yet the doleful destinies
of Troy become to end
¶And what more grievous chances yet
prepare the gods to send?
¶The caves and de•s of hell be rent
for Troians greater fear,
And from the bottoms of their tombs
the hidden sprightes appear.
May none but Greeks alone from hell
return to life again?
Would god the fates would finish soon
the sorrows I sustain,
Death thankful were, a common care
The Troians all oppress,
But me alas amaseth most
the fearful heaviness.
That all astonished a• for dread,
and horror of the sight:
That in my sleep appeared to me,
by dream this latter night.
Declare what sights your dream hath showed
and tell what doth you fear.
¶Two parts of all the silent night,
almost then passed wear.
And then the clear seven clustred beams
of stars: were fallen to rest.
And first the sleep so long unknown
my wearied eyes oppressed.
If this be sleep the astonished maze,
of mind in heavy mood,
When suddenly before mine eyes,
the spright of Hector stood.
Not like as he the Greeks was w•ned
to battle to require
Or when amid the Gracious ships,
he threw the brands of fire.
Nor such as raging on the Greeks,
with slaughtering stroke had slain,
And bare in dede the spoils of him
that did Achilles fain.
His countenance not now so bright.
Nor of so lively chere,
But sad and heavy like to owres,
and clad with ugly hear.
It did me good to se him though,
when shaking then his head:
Shake of thy sleep in hast he said,
and quickly leave thy bed.
Convey into some secret place,
our son, O faithful wife,
This only hope there is to help,
find mean to save his life.
Leave of thy piteous tears he said
dost thou yet wail for Troy?
Would god it lay on ground full flat,
so ye might save the boy.
Up stir he said thy self in hast,
convey him privily,
Save if ye may the tender blood.
of Hectors progeny.
Then straight in trembling fear I w•nte
and roulde mine eyes abought
Forgetting long my child, pore wre•che,
and after Hector sought.
But straight alas• I wist not how
the spright away did passt,
And me forsook before I could,
my husband once embrasse.
O child: O noble fathers brood
and Troians only joy,
O worthy seed of thauncient blood.
and beaten house of Troye.
O image of thy father lo,
thou lively bear his face,
This countenance, 〈◊〉 my Hector •ad,
and even such was his pace.
The pitch of all his body such,
his hands thus would he bear.
His shoulders high, his th•etning 〈◊〉
even such as thine they wear.
O son: begot to late for Troye
but borne to soon for me,
Shall ever time yet come again
and happy day may be,
That thou may once revenge, and build
again the towers of Troye,
And to the town and Troians both
restore their name with joy?
But why do I, forgetting state
of present destiny.
So great things wish• enough for cap∣tiues
is to live only.
Alas what privy• place is left
my little child to hyde?
What seat so secret may be found
where thou may safely bide?
The tower that with the walls of gods
so valiant was of might,
Through all the world so notable
so flourishing to sight,
Is turned to dust: and five hath all
consumed that was in Trope•
Of all the town not so much now
is left to hyde the boy.
What place were best to choose for guile
the holly tomb is here,
That thenmies sword will spare to spoil•
where lythe my husband dear.
Which costly work his father built•
king Pryame liberal,
And it up raised with charges great,
for Hectors funeral.
Herein the bones and ashes both
of Hector lo they lye,
Best is that I commit the son
to his fathers custody.
A cold and fearful sweat doth ron,
through out my members all,
Alas I careful wretch do fear,
what chance may the befall.
¶Hide him away: this only way
hath saved many more,
To make the enmies to believe,
that they were dead before.
He will be sought: scant any hope
remains of fattens•
The payse of his nobility
doth him so sore oppress.
¶What way were best to work: that none
our doings might bewray?
¶Let none bear witness what ye doe
remove them all away.
¶What of the enmies •ske me: where
Astianax doth remain?
¶•hen shall ye boldly answer make
that he in Troy was slain.
¶What shall it help to have him hyd?
at length they will him find•
¶At first the enmies rage is fierce
delay doth slake his mind.
¶But what prevails, since free from fear
we can him never hyde?
¶Let yet the wretch take his defence
more careless there to bide.
¶What land unknown out of the w•y
what unfrequented place,
May keep thee safe? who aids our fear?
who shall defend our case?
Hector Hector, that evermore
thy friends did well defend,
Now chiefly aid thy wife and child
and vs some succour send.
Take charge to kept and cover close
the treasures of thy wife,
And in thy ashes hyde thy soon
preserve in tomb his life.
Draw ne'er my child unto the tomb
why fliest thou backward so?
Thou take great scorn to lurk in deus
thy noble hart I know.
I see thou art asham•e to fear
shake of thy princely mind,
And bear thy breast as thee behooves
as chance hath thee assinde.
Behold our case: and see what flock
remains now of Troy
The tomb: I woeful captive wretch
and thou a sly boy.
But yield we must to sorry 〈◊〉
thy chance must break thy breast,
Go to: creep underneath, thy fa∣theirs
holy seats to rest.
I fought the fates, may wretches help•
thou hast thy safeguard there.
If not: all ready then pore fool
thou hast thy sepulchre.
The tomb him closely hydes: but le••
your fear should him detraye,
Let him here lye, and far from hence,
go ye some other way.
¶ The les he fears that fears at h••de
and yet if need be so,
If ye think meet a little hens
for safety let vs go.
¶A little while keep silence now
refrain your plaint and cry,
His cursed foot now hythee moves
the lord of Cephalye.
¶Now open earth, and tho• my spouse
from Styx rent up the ground,
Deep in thy bosom hyde my son,
that he may not be sound.
Ullysses comes with doubtful pace
and changed countenance
He knits in hart deceitful craft
for some more grievous chance.
¶ Though I be made the 〈◊〉
of heavy news to you•
This one thing first I shall desire
that ye take this for true.
That though the words come from my mo•th,
and I my message tell,
Of truth yet are they 〈◊〉 of mine
ye may believe me well.
It is the word of all the Greeks
and they the authors bee,
Whom Hectors blo••• 〈…〉
their countries for to see.
Our careful trust of peace unsure
doth styll the Greeks detain,
And evermore our doubtful fear,
yet draws vs back again.
And •u••reth not our wearied hands,
our weapons to forsake,
In child yet of Andromach•,
While Trojan• comfort take,
¶ And ••yth your Augur Calchas so?
¶ Though Calchas nothing said
Yet Hector tells it vs himself,
Of whose seed are we frayed.
The worthy blood of noble men
oftimes we see it plain,
Doth after in their heirs succeed
and quickly sprynges again.
For so the horneles young•ng yet,
of high and sturdy best,
With lofty neck, and branched brow,
doth shortly rule the rest.
The tender 〈◊〉, that of the lop∣ped
stock doth yet remain,
To match the tree that bare the bough,
in time starts up again.
With equal to••e to former wood,
the room it doth supply,
And spreddes on soil allow the shade,
to heaven his branches hye.
Thus of one spark by chance yet le••
it happens so full oft.
The fire hath quickly caught 〈…〉
and ••amthe again aloft,
So fear we yet least Hectors blood,
might rise ere it be long,
Fear castes in all thextremitie
and oft interprets wrong.
If ye respeckte our case, ye may
not blame these old soldiers
Though after years &amp; months twice 〈◊〉,
they fear again the wars.
And other travails, dreading Troye,
not yet to be well won,
A great thing doth the Gracious move,
the fear of Hectors soon.
Rid vs of fear, this stays our 〈◊〉,
and plucks their •ask again,
And in the haven our n•u•e sticks,
till Hectors blood• •e slain.
Count me not ••erce for that by fates
I Hectors son require,
For I as well if chance it would
Orestes should desire.
But sins that needs it must be so,
bear it with patient hart,
And suffer that which Agamem∣non,
suffered in good part.
¶Alas my child would god 〈…〉,
yet in thy mothers hand,
And that I knew what destinies,
the held, or in what land.
For never should the mothers •••th,
her tender child forsake,
Though through my dressed the 〈◊〉 all,
their cruel weapons struck.
Nor though the Greeks, with pinching bands
of iron: my hands had bound,
Or else in fervent flame of fire
beset my body round.
But now my little child (poor wretch)
alas where might he bee?
Alas what cruel destiny,
what chance• hath hoped to thee?
Art thou yet rangeing in the fields
and wander there abroad?
Or smothered else in dusty smoke
of Troy: or ouertrode•
Or have the Greeks thee slain alas
and laughed to see thy blood•
Or torn art thou with Jaws of beasts
or cast to fowls for foe•de?
¶Dissemble not, hard is for thee
Ulysses to disceiue,
I can full well the mothers crafts
and subtlety perceive.
The policy of Goddesses,
Ullysses hath undone,
Set all these feigned words aside,
tell me where is thy soon?
¶Where is Hector? where all the rest?
that had with Troy their fall•
Where Pryamus? you ask for one
but I require of all.
¶Thou shalt constrained be to tell
the thing thou dost deny.
¶A happy chance were death, to •e•
that doth desire to dye,
¶Who most desires to dye: would •ay∣nest
live when death drawthe on,
These noble words with present fear
of death: would soon v• •ou.
¶Ulysses if ye will constrain
Andromacha with fear,
Threaten my life, for now to dye
my chief desire it wear
¶With steppes, with fire, tormenting death
we will the truth out wrest.
And dolor shall thee force, to tell
the secretes of thy breast.
And what thy hart hath deepest hyd
for payne thou shalt express
Oftymes thextremitie prevails,
much more then ientlenes.
¶Set me in midst of burning flame,
with wounds my body rent,
Use all the means of cruelty,
that ye may all invent.
Prouethe with thirst, and hunger both,
and every torment try,
Pearce through my •ides with burning irons,
in prison let me lye.
Spare not the worst ye can deuyse
(if ought be worse then this)
Yet never geat ye more of me
I wot not where he is,
¶ It is but vain to hyde the thing
that straight ye will deteckte.
No fears may move the mothers hart.
she doth them all neglect.
This tender love ye bear your child,
wherein ye stand so stout.
So much more circumspectly war•the,
the Greeks to look about.
Least after ten years trachte of time.
and battle borne so far.
Some one should live that on our i will∣drone,
might renew the war.
As for my self, what Calchas says,
I would not fear at all.
But on Telemachus I dread,
the smart of wars would fa•.
¶Now will I make Ulysses glad,
and all the Greeks also.
Needs must thou woeful wretch confess.
declare thy hidden wo.
Rejoice ye sons of Atreus,
there is no cause of dred.
Be glad Ullysses tell the Greeks,
that Hectors son is ded.
¶By what assurance proves thou that•
How shall we credit the?
¶What ever thing the en•ies hand.
may threaten, h•pp to me
Let spedy fates me slay forthwith,
and earth me hide at ones,
And after death from tomb again,
remove yet Hectors bones,
Except my soon already now,
do rest among the ded,
And that except Astyanax.
into his tomb be fed.
¶Then fully •re the fates 〈◊〉
with Hectors childes decease:
Now shall I bear the Gracious word,
of sure and certain peace.
Ulysses why what dost thou now?
the Greeks will every chone,
Believe thy words: whom credit she thou?
the mothers tale alone.
Think thou for safeguard of her child
the mother will not lie?
And bread the more the worse mischance,
to give her son to dye?
Her faith she binds with bond of other,
the truth to verify,
What thing is more of weight to fear,
then so to swear and lye?
Now call thy crafts together all,
bestir thy wits and mind,
And show thy self Ulysses now,
the truth herin to find.
Search well the mothers mind: behold
she weeps and waileth out,
And here and there with doubtful pace,
she ranges all about.
Her careful ears she doth apply,
to harken what I say,
More afraid she seems then sorrowful.
Now work some wily way.
For 〈…〉 there is,
and crafty policy,
Yet once again by other 〈◊〉,
I will the mother tri•.
Thou wretched woman may reioye•,
that dead he is: alas
More doleful death by destiny
for him decreed there was.
From Turrets top to have been cast
and cruelly been slain.
Which only tower of all the rest,
doth yet in Troy remain.
¶My spright fa••th me, my limbs do qua•e,
fear doth my wits confound,
And as the y•e congeals with frost.
my blood with cold is bound.
¶•he trembles to• this way, this way
I will the truth out wrest,
The mothers fear detecteth all
the secretes of her breast.
I will renew her fear: go •ears
bestir ye speedily,
To seek this enemy of the Greeks,
where ever that he lye.
Well done, he will be found at length,
go to, s•ill seek him out,
Now shall he dye: what dost thou fear?
why dost thou look about?
¶Would god that any cause there were,
yet left that might me fray,
My hart at last now all is l••t,
hath laid all fear away.
¶Sins that your child now hath ye say
already suffered death.
And with his blood we may not pourge
the hostess as Calchas saith.
Our flete pass not (as well inspired,
doth Calchas prophecy)
Till Hectors ashes cast abroad,
The waives may pacify,
And tomb be rent, now sins the boy
hath escaped his destiny.
Needs must we break this holy tomb
where Hectors ashes lye.
¶What shall I do? my mind distress∣ted,
is with double fear,
On the one my son, on tother side
my husbands ashes dear.
Alas which part, should move me most,
the cruel gods I call,
To witness with me in the truth,
and ghosts that guide thee all.
Hector, that nothing in my soon
is else that pleases me,
But thou alone• god grant him life,
he might resemble the,
Shall Hectors ashes •rowned be?
bide I such cruelty,
To see his bones cast in the seas?
yet let Astianax dye•
And can thou wretched mother bide,
thint own chyldes death to see?
And 〈◊〉 from the hy• towers top
that headlong thrown he be?
I can, and will take in good part,
his death and cruel payne,
So that my Hector 〈◊〉 death,
•e not removed again.
The boy that life and senses has
may feel his payne and dye,
But Hector lo his death has placed,
at rest in tomb to lye.
What dost thou stay? determine which
thou wilt preserve of twain.
Art thou in doubt? save this: lo here
thy Hector doth remain.
Doth Hectors be, the one quick of spright
and drawing toward his strength
And one that may perhaps revenge
his fathers death at length.
Alas I can not save them both
I think that best it wear.
That of the twain I saved him,
that doth the Grecyans fear.
¶It shall be done that Calchas words
to vs doth Prophecy•
And now shall all this sumpteous work
be thrown down utterly.
¶That once ye sold?
¶I will it all
from top to bottom rend
¶The faith of Gods I call upon
Achilles vs defend.
And Pyrrhus aid thy fathers right
¶This tomb abroad shall lye
¶O mischief, never durst the Greeks
show yet such cruelty.
Ye strain the Temples, and the Gods
that most have fauorde you,
The dead ye spare not, on their t••bes
your fury rages now.
I will their weapons all resist
my self with naked hand,
The ire of heart shall geeue me strength,
their armour to withstand.
As fierce as did the Amazons
beat down the Greeks in fight,
And Menas once enspyrde with God,
in sacrifice doth smyght:
With spear in hand, and while with few∣rios
pace she treads the ground.
And wood as one in rage: she strikes
and feelythe not the wound:
So will I run on midst of them
and on their weapons dye,
And in defence of Hectors tomb,
among his ashes lye.
¶Cease ye • doth rage and fury vain
of woman move ye ought.
Dispatch with speed what I command,
and pluck down all to nought.
¶Slay me rather here with sword
rid me out of the way.
Break up the deep Auerne, and rid
my destinies delay.
Rise Hector and byset thy foes
break thou Ulysses ire,
A spright art good enough for him,
behold he casts fire.
And weapon shakes with mighty hand
do ye not Greeks him see?
Or else doth Hectors spright appear
but only unto me?
Down quite withal.
What wilt thou suf∣fer
both thy son be slain,
And after death thy husbands bones
to be removed again?
Perhaps thou may with prayer yet
appease the Gracious all,
Else down to ground the holly tomb
of Hector, straight shall fall.
Let rather dye the child poor wretch
and let the Greeks him kill,
Then father and the son should cause
the tone the others ill.
Ulysses, at thy knees I fall,
and humbly ask mercy.
These hands that no mans feet else knew,
first at thy fete they lye,
Take pity on the mothers case,
and sorrows of my breast,
Vouchsafe my prayers to receive,
and grant me my request.
And by how much the more the gods
have the advanced hye,
More easily strike the poor estate,
of wretched misery.
God grant the chaste bed of thy god∣lie
wife Penelope,
May the receive, and so again
La•rte may the see.
And that thy son Telemachus,
may mete thee joyfully,
His graundsers years, and fathers wit•.
to pass full happily.
Take pity on the mothers tears,
her little child to save,
He is my only comfort left
and thonely joy I have.
¶Bring furth thy son and ask.
COme hither child out of thy dens to me
thy wretched mothers lamentable store,
This pa•e Ulysses, •o this bade is he,
that stays your ships, • stares you so sore.
Submit thy self my soon with humble hand,

Think it no shame, as now the case doth stand

Loc such the conquest was of Hercules

Do only Her•tes cruel weapons pirate
and may no end be of your cruelty?
No less then Pryame kneels to thee this boy
that lies and asks only life of thee.
As for the rule and governance of Troy
where ever fortune will there let it bee.
Take mercy on the mothers ruthful tears
that with their streams my checks do overflow
And spare this guiltless infants tender years
that humbly falls at thy feet so lowe.
OF trenthe the mothers great sorrow,

But yet the mothers of the Greeks,
of need must move me mo•e.
To whom this hope may cause in time
a great calamytis.
¶may ever he the burnt ruins
of Troy reedify?
And shall these hands in time to come,
ereckt the town again?
If this be thonely help we have,
there doth no hope remain
For Troy, we stand not now in case
to cause your fear of mind,
Doth ought avail his fathers force,
or stock of noble kind?
His fathers heart abated was.
he drawn the walls abought.
Thus euell happs, the haughetest hart
at length they bring to nought.
If ye will needs oppress a wretch
what thing more grievous wear.
Then on his noble neck he should
the yoke of bondage bear?
To serve in life, doth any man
this to a king deny?
¶Not Ulysses wylth his death
but Calchas Prophecy
O false invent or of descried•

By manhood of whose hand in war,
no man did ever dye.
But by disceite and crafty train
of mind that mischief seeks,
Before this time full many one
dead is: ye of the Greeks.
The Prophets words and guiltless gods
says thou my son require?
Nay: mischief of thy breast it is
thou dost his death desire.
Thou night soldier, and stought of harts

This enterprise thou take••• alone
and that by open day.
¶Ulysses manhood well to Greeks

¶A little stay, while I my last

And have with oft embracing him,
my greedy sorrows filed.
¶Thy greuons sorrows to redress,
would god it lay in me,
But at thy will to take delay
of time, I grant it thee.
Now take thy last leave of thy son,
and fill thy self with tears,
Oft times the weeping of the eyes,
the inward grief out wears.
¶O dear, o sweet, thy mothers pledge,
farewell my only joy.
Farewell the flower of honour left
of beaten house of Troy
O Troians last calamity
and fear to Gracious part
Farewell thy mothers only hope,
and vain comfort of hart.
Oft wished I thee thy fathers strength.
and half thy graundsyres years.
But all for nought, the Gods have all
dispoynted our desires.
Thou never shalt in •eagle court

Nor to thy people give dec••es
nor lead with law thy land.
Nor yet thine enemies overcome
by might of handy stroke,
Nor lend the conquered nations all
under thy servile yoke.
Thou never shalt beat down in fight
and Greeks with sword pursewe,
Nor at thy Chariot Pyr•hus pluck
as Achylles Hector drew.
And never shall these tender hands
thy weapons weld and wrest,
Thou never shalt in woods pursue
the wild and mighty beast.
Nor as accustomed is by guise
and sacrifice in Troye,
With measure swift: between the aul∣ters
shalt thou dance with joy.
O grievous kind of cruel death
that doth remain for thee,
More woeful thing then Hector• death
the walls of Troye shall see.
¶Now break of all thy mothers tears
I may no more time spend.
The grievous sorrows of thy heart
will never make an end.
¶Ulysses spare as yet my tears
and grant a wht•e delays,
To close his eyes yet with my hands
ere he depart away.
Thou dye•• but young: yet feared thou art
thy Troy doth wait for thee.
Go noble hart thou shalt again
the noble Troians see.
¶ Help me mother?
¶ Alas my child
why takste thou hold by me?
In vain thou callte where help none is
I can not succour thee.
As when the little tender beast
that hears the Lyon cry,
Straight for defence he seeks his dam
and crouching down doth lye.
The cruel beast when once remo∣ued
is the dam away,
In greedy jaw with ravening bit
doth snatch the tender pray
So straight the enmies will thee take
and from my side the Bear.
Receive my kiss and tears poor child
receive my rented hear.
Depart thou hence now full of me
and to thy father go,
Salute my Hector in my name
and tell him of my woe.
Complain thy •• others grief to him
if former cares may move,
The spryghtes: and that in funeral flame
they leese not all their love.
O cruel Hector suffrest thou
thy wife to be oppressed•
With bond of Grecyans heavy yoke
and lie thou still at rest•
Achylles rose • take here again
my tears and rented hear,
And (all that I have le•te to send)
this kiss thy father bear.
Thy coat yet for my comfort leave
the tomb hath touched it
If of his ashes ought here lye
I will seek it every whit.
¶There is no measure of thy tears
I may no longer staye
Defer no farther our return
break of our ships delay.
O Jove that leadst the lamps of fire
and dekst with slamyng star•es the sky
Why is it ever thy desire
to care their course so orderly?
That now the frost the leaves hath worn
and now the spring doth cloth the tree,
Now fyry Leo rypes the Corn
and still the soil should changed be?
But why art thou that all doos•e guide
between whose hands the pools do sway•
And at whose will the Orbs do slide
careless of mans estate always?
Regarding not the good mans case,
nor caring how to hurt the ill
Chance bears rule in every place,
and turns mans estate at will.
She gives the wrong the upper hand
the better part she doth oppress,
She makes the highest lowe to stand
her kingdom all is orderlesse.
O par•it proof of her frailty,
the princely towers of Troye bet down
The flower of Asya here ye see
with turn of hand quite overthrown•
The tuthfull end of Hectors son
whom to his death the Greeks have led
His fatal hour is come and gone
and by this time the child is ded
Yet still alas more cares increase,
o Troians doleful destiny,
Fast doth approach the maids decease
and now Polyxena shall dye.
WHat ever woeful wedding yet,
were cause of funeral.
Of walling, tears, blood, slaughter 〈◊〉
or other mischief• all,
I worthy match for Helena,
and meet for me it ware,
My wedding torch hath bin the cause,
of all the Troians care.
I am constrained to hurt them yet,
after their overthrow
The false and fained marriages,
of Pyrthus must I show.
And give the maid the Greeks attire•
and by my policy,
Shall Marries sister be betrayed,
and b• 〈◊〉 shall dye.
But let her be begu••ed thus,
the les should be her pain
If that •nware, without the fear
of death: she might be slain.
What ceasest thou the will of Gr•ekes,
and message to fulfil?
Of hurt constrained the fault returned
to thauthor of the ill.
O noble virgin of the fa∣mous
house: and stock of Troy,
To thee, the Gresians have me sent
I bring the news of joy.
The gods •ue on thy afflicted state,
more merciful they be,
A great and happy marriage lo,
they have prepared for the.
Thou never should if Troy had stood,
so nobly wedded be,
Nor Priame never could prefer,
the to so hye degree.
Whom flower of all the G••cyon name,
the prince of honour hongur hie.
That bears the scepters over all.
The land of Thessal•e,
Doth in the law of wedlock chose
and for his wife require•
To sacred rig•tes of lawful bed,
doth Pyr•hus thee desire
Lo Thetys great with all the rest,
of gods that guide by se•.
Eche one shall thee account as theirs,
and joy by wedding •ea.
And Peleus shall thee daughters call,
when thou art Pyrthus wife,
And Ner•us shall account thee his
the space of all thy life.
Put of thy mourning 〈◊〉 now.
this regal vesture wear
Forget henceforth thy cantiue state,
and semely broyde thy hear.
Thy fall hath lift thee higher up.
and doth thee more advance.
Oft to be taken in the war,
doth bring the better chance.
¶This ill the Troians never knew
in all their griefs and pain,
Before this time ye never made,
vs to rejoice in vain.
Troye towers give light, o semely time
for marriage to be made
Who would refuse the wedding day
that Helayne doth persuade?
The Plague and Ruin of eche part
behold dost thou not see,
These tombs of noble men: and how
their bones here scattered bee?
Thy bride bed hath been cause of this
for thee all these be ded,
For thee the blood of Asya both
and Europe hath been shed.
When thou in joy and pleasure both
the fighting folk from far,
Haste would: in doubt to whom to wish
the glory of the war.
Go to prepare the marriages
what need the torches light?
Be hold the towers of Troy do shyne
with brands that blase full bright.
O Troians all set to your hands,
this wedlock celebrate:
Lament this day with woeful cry
and tears in seemly rate.
¶ Though care do cause the want of 〈◊〉
and reasons rule deny.
And heavy hap doth oftimes hate
his mates in misery,
Yet I before most hateful judge
dare well defend my part,
That I of all your grievous cares
sustain the greatest smart.
Andromach• for Hector weeps,
for Priame Hecuba,
For only Parys privily
bewails Helen•.
A harde and grievous thing it is
captivity to bear.
In Troy that yoke I suffered long
a prisoner whole ten year.
Turned are the fates, Troy beaten down.
to Greece I must repeat,
The native country to have lost
is ill, but worse to fear.
For dread thereof you need not care
your evils all be paste.
On me both parts will vengeance take
all lights to me at last.
Whom eche man prisoner takes God won
she stands in slipper staye,
And me not captive made by lot
yet Parys led aways
I have been cause of all these wars
and then your woes w•re wrought,
When first your ships the Spartan seas
and land of Grecia sought.
But if the Goddess wilde it so
that I their pray should be,
And for reward to her beauties judge
she had appointed me.
Then pardon Parys: think this thing
in wrathful judge doth lye,
The sentence Menclaus gives
and he this case shall try.
Now turn thy plaints •ndromache.
and weep for Polyxeyne.
mine eyes for sorrows of my hart.
their tears may not refrain.
¶Alas what care makes Heleyue weeps
What grief doth she lament?
Declare what crafts Ulisses castes,
what mischief hath he sent?
Shall she from height of Idey hill
be headlong tombled down?
Or else out of the turrets top
in Troy, shall she be thrown?
Or will they cast her from the cliues,
into Svgeon se•es?
In bottom of the surging waives,
to end her ruthful days?
Show what thy countenance hides, • tell
the secretes of thy breast:
Some woes in Pyrthus wedding are
far worse then all the rest.
Go to, give sent case on the maid,
pronounce her destiny:
Delude no longer our mishaps,
we are prepared to dye.
¶Would god there ponder of the gods
would give his dome so right:
That I also on point of sword
might leese the loathsome light.
Or at Actulles tomb, with stroke
of Pyrrhus hand be s•own:
And bear a part of all thy fates
O wretched Polyxeyne.
Whom yet Achilles wooth to wed.
and where his ashes lie•
Requires that thy blood be shed,
and at his tomb to die.
¶Behold lo, how her noble minds
of death doth gladly hear.
She decks her self: her regal weed,
in semely wise to wear.
And to her head she sets her hand,
the broyded hear to lay•
To wed she thought it death: to dye,
she thinks a wedding day.
But help, alas, my mother sowndes.
to hear her daughters death.
Arise: pluck up your hart and take,
again the panting breath.
Black good mother how slender stay•
that doth thy life sustain?
A little thing shall happy thee.
thou art almost past thy payne.
Her brethe returns: she doth revive,
her limbs their life do take.
So se when wretches fine would die•
how death doth them forsake.
¶Doth yet Achilles live alas,
to work the Troians spite?
Doth he rebel against vs yet?
O hand of Parys light.
The very tomb and ashes lo•,
yet thirsts for our blood.
A happy heap of childern •ate•
on every side me stood.
It wearied me to deal the mo•
theirs kiss among them all
The rest are lost and this alone•,
now doth me mother call.
Thou only child of Hecuba,
a comfort left to me,
A stayer of my sorry state,
and shall I now leese thee?
Depart O wretched soul, and from
this careful carcass fly,
And case me of such ruthful fates,
to se my daughter dye.
My weeping wettes, alas my eyes•
and staines them over all,
And down my cheeks the sudden streams
and showers of tears do fall.
But thou dere daughter may be glad
Cassandra would rejoice,
Or Hectors wife thus wed to bee
if they might have their choice.
¶We are the wretches Hecuba
in cursed case we stand,
Whom straight the ship shall toss by seus
into a foreign land.
But as for Heleyns grieves be gone
and turned to the best,
She shall again her native con∣trey
see: and live at rest.
¶Ye would the more envy my state
if ye might know your own,
¶And grouthe there yet more grief to me
that er•te I have not known?
¶Such ma••ters must ye serve as doth
by chance of lots befall
¶Whose servant am I then become
whom shall I moister call?
¶By lot ye fall to Pyrrhus hands
you are his prisoner.
¶Cassandra is happy: fury saves
perhaps and Phebus her.
¶These king of Greeks Cassandra keeps
and his captive is she
¶Is any one among them all
that prisoner would have me?
¶You chanced to Ulysses are
his pray ye are become.
¶Alas what cruel, dire and ire∣full
delete of the dome.
What god unjust doth so divide,
the captives to their lords?
What grievous arbiter is he?
that to such choice accords.
What cruel hand to wretched folk,
so evil fates hath caste?
Who hath among Achilles are∣more,
Hectors mother placed?
Now am I captive and beset,
with all calamity.
My bondage grieves me not, but him
to serve it shames me.
He that Achilles spoils hath won,
shall Hectors also have:
Shall barren land enclosed with seas,
receive my bones in grave?
Lead me Ulysses where thou wilt.
lead me, I make no stay,
My moister I, and me my fates,
shall follow every way.
Let never calm come to the seas,
but let them rage with windt,
Come fire and sword, mine own mischafice
and Priames let me find.
In mean time haps this deep distress
my cares can know no calm:
I ran the race with Priamus
but he hath won the Palm.
But Pyrthus comes with swiftened pace
and threatening brows doth wrest.
What stayest thou Pyrthus? strike thy sword
now through this woeful breast.
And both at ones the parents of
thy fathers wife now slay,
Murderer of age, likes thee her blood?
he drawth my daughter away.
Defile the gods and stain the sprighte••
of hell with slaughtered blood,
To ask your mercy what avails?
our prayers do no good.
The vengeance ask I on your ships,
that it the gods may pleas,
According to this sacrifice.
to guide you on the seas.
This wish I to your thousand sails,
Gods wrath light on them all,
Even to the ship that bears me,
what ever may befall.
A Comfort is to mans calamity
A doleful flock of fellows in distress.
And sweet to him that morurnes in misery•
To hear them whale whom sorrows like oppr••
In depest care his grief him bytes the les,
That his estate bewails not all alone,
But sees with him the tears of many one.
For still it is the chief delight in woe,
And joy of them that sonke in sorrows are,
To see like fates byfall to many more,
That may take part of all their woeful fare.
And not alone to be oppressed with care.
There is no wight: of woe that doth complain•,
when al the rest do like mischance sustain.
In all this world if happy man were none,
None (though he were) would think himself a wretch,
Let once the rich with heaps of gold be gone,
whose hundred head his pastors ouerretche,
Then would the poor mans hart begin to stretch
There is no wretch whose life him doth displease
But in respect of those that live at ease.
Sweet is to him that stands in deep distress,
To see no man in joyful plight to be,
Whose only vessel, wind and wave oppress,
Full sore his chance bewails and wepeth he,
That with his own none others wrack doth se
When he alone makthe shipwrak on the sand
And naked falls to long desired land.
A thousand sail who sees to drenche in seas
with better will the storm hath overpassed
His heavy hap doth him the less displease,
When broken boards abroad be many cast
And shipwrecked ships to shore they flit full fast,
With doubled waives when stopped is the flood,
With heap of them that there have lost their good.
Full sore did Phryxus Hellens loss complain,
What time the leader of his flock of sheep,
Upon his back alone he bare them twain,
And wet his golden lockes amid the deep.
In piteous plaint alas he began to weep
The death of her it did him deep displease,
That shypwrak made amid the drenchyng seas.
And piteous was the plaint and heavy mood
Of woeful Pyr•ha and eke Deucalion,
That nought beheld about them but the flood,
When they of all mankind were left alone
Amid the seas full sore they made their moan
To see themselves thus left alive in woe
When neither land they saw nor fellows more.
A non these plaints, and Troianes tears shall quasi,
And here and there the ship th•m toss by seas
When trumpets sound sh•ll warn to hoise up sail
And through the waives with wind to seek their way••:
Then shall these captives go to end their days
In land unknown: when once with hasty ore
The drenching deep they take and shone the shore.
What state of mind shall then in wretches •e,
When shore shall sink from sight and seas arise?
When I they hill to lurk aloof they see?
Then point with hand from far where Troia lyse,
Shall child and mother: talking in this wise:
Lo yonder Troye, where smoke it fumes hye,
By this the Troianes, shall their country spy.
ODyre fierce, wretched, horrible,
o civil fates accutlle,
Of Matsh 〈…〉 years bloodshed blows.
the woefullest and the wurste.
A la• which s•old I sir•• bewail?
thy cares Andromacha•
Or else lament the wretched age
of woeful •ecaba?
What ever ••ns calamities
y• whale for mine it is
I bear the smart of all their woes,
eche other feels but his.
Who ever he, I am the wretch
all hippos to me at last.
Slain is the maid, and from the w•lles
of Troy: the child is cast.
But both, (as them became) they toke
their death, with s•omack stout.
Declare the double slaughters then•
and tell the whole throughout.
¶One tower of all the rest ye know•
doth yet in Troy remain,
Where Pryam wonted was to sit,
and view the armies twain.
His little Nephew the with him
to lead and from a far,
His fathers •ightes with fire and sword•
to show, and feats of war.
This tower, sometime well known by fame,
and Troians honour most.
Is now with captains of the Greeks,
beset on every coast.
With swift recourse and from the ships.
in clustred heaps anon.
Both tag and •egg, they run to g••••
what thing should there be done.
Some clime the hills, to seek a place•
where they might see it best,
Some on the rocks a tiptoe stand•
to overlook the rest.
Some on their temples wear the Pine,
some beach, some crowns o• bay.
For garlands torn is every tree,
that stands in their way.
Some from the highest mountains top,
aloof beholds all
Some sca•e the buildings half yburnte,
and some the ruinous wall
Ye some there wear (o mischief lo)
that for the more despite,
The tomb of Hector sitts upon,
beholders of the sight.
With princely pace Ulysses then,
past through the preasyd b•nde
Of Greeks, king Pryames little No∣phew,
leading by the hand.
The child with vnrepining gate
past through his enemies hands,
Up toward the walls, and as anon
in turrets top he stands,
From thence down, his lo•tie looks
he cast on every part,
The nearer death more free from care
he seemed, and fear of heart.
Amid his •os, his stomach swells,
and fierce he was to sight,
Like Tigers wholly, that threats in vain
with toothless chap to bight,
Alas, for pity them eche one,
〈◊〉 on his tender years,
And all the rowte that present were,
for him they shed their tears.
Yea not Ulysses them restraynde,
but trickling down they fall,
And only he, wept not, (poor fool,)
whom they bewailed all.
But while on Gods Ulysses called,
and Calchas words expound,
In midst of Pryames land alas,
the child leapt down to ground.
¶What cruel Colchus could or scythe
such slaughter take in hand?
Or by the shore of Caspyan sea,
what barbarous lawless land?
Busyrides to thaulters yet,
no infants blood hath shed:
Nor never yet were children slain,
for feast of Dyomed.
Who shall alas in tomb thee lay,
or hyde thy limbs again?
¶What limbs frō such a headlong fall,
could in a child remain?
His bodies payse, thrown down to ground,
has battered all his bones,
His face, his noble fathers marks,
are spoiled against the stoa•es.
His neck anointed is: his head
so dashed with flint stone stroke,
That scattred is the brain about,
the sculle is all to broke.
Thus lies he now dismembered corps,
deformde, and all to rent.
Lot herein doth he yet likewise,
his father represent.
What time the child, had headlong fallen
thus from the walls of Troye.
And all the Greeks them selves bewaylde,
the slaughter of the boy.
Yet straight return they back, and at
Achilles tomb again
The second mischief go to work,
the death of Polyxeyne
This tomb the waives of surging seas,
beset the utter side.
The other part the fields encloase
about, and pastors wide.
In vale environed with hills,
that round about do rise.
A sloop on height erected are
the banks, in theater wise.
By all the shore then swarm the Greeks
and thyck on heaps they press:
Some hoop that by her death, they shall
their ships delay release.
Some other joy, their enmies stock
thus beaten down to bee:
A great part of the people, both
the slaughter hate and see.
The Troians eke, no less frequent
their own calamities,
And all afraid, beheld the last
of all their miseries.
When first proceedyd torches bright
as guise of wedlock is.
And author thereof led the way
the lady Tyndaris.
Such wedlock (pray the Troians then)
god send Herinyona•
And would god to her husband so,
restored were Helena.
Fear masde eche part, but Polyxene,
her bashefull look down cast:
And more then erst her glittering eyes,
and beauty shined at last.
As sweetest seems then Phebus light.
when down his beams do sway,
When stars again, with night at hand,
oppress the doubtful day.
Astonished much the people were,
and all, they her commend.
And now much more then ever •arst,
they praised her, at her end.
Some with her beauty moved were,
some with her tender years:
Some to behold the turns of chance,
and how eche thing thus wears.
But most them mons her valiant mind,
and lofty stomach hye,
So strong, so stout, so ready of heart,
and well prepaid to dye.
Thus pass they furth, and bold, before
king Pyrrhus god the maid,
They pity her, they marvel her,
their hearts were all afraid.
As soon as then, the hard hill top.
(where dye she should) they trod.
And hye upon his fathers tomb,
the youthful Pyrrhus stood.
The manly maid she never shronke,
one foot, nor backward drew
But boldly turns to meet the stroke,
with sloute unchanged he••e
Her courage moves eche one, and •o
a strange thing monstrous like.
That Pyrthus even himself stood styll,
for dread, and durst not strike.
But as he had, his glittering sword,
in her to hills up done,
The purple blood, at mortal wound,
then gushing out it spoon.
No yet her courage her forsook,
when dyeng in that stownde,
She fell as therthe should her revenge,
with Ireful rage to ground.
Eche people wept: the Troians first,
with privy fearful cry.
The Gracious •ke, eche one bewaylde,
her death, apparently.
This order had the sacrifice,
her blood the tomb up droonke,
No drop remaynth aboue the ground,
but down forthwith it soon•e.
Now go, now go ye Greeks, &amp; now,
repair yt safel•e home.
With careless ships, and hoised sails,
Now cut the sallt sea •ome.
The child and virgin, both be slain,
your battles•••ysht are.
Alas where shall I end my age?
or whether bear my care?
Shall I my daughter, or my no∣phew?
or my husband moan?
My country else, or all at once?
or else my self alone?
My wish is death, that children doth
and virgins fiercely takes
Where ever cruel death doth haste
to strike, it me for sakes.
Amid the enmies weapons all,
amid both sword and fire,
All night sought for, thou fliest from me,
that do thee most desire.
Not flame of fire, not fall of tower,
nor cruel enemies hand,
Hath rid my life: how near alas,
could death to Pryame stand?
¶Now captives all, with swift recourse
repair ye to the seayes,
Now spread the ships, their sails abroad,
and forth they seek their ways.
