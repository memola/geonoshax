THe night is gon. &amp; dreadful day
begins at length to appear
And Lucifer beset with Clouds,
himself aloft doth rear.
And gliding forth with heavy hew,
A dolful blase doth bear (in Skies.)
Now shall the houses void be scene,
with Plagues devoured quite:
And slaughter yt the night hath made,
shall day bring forth to light.
Doth any man in Princely throe•e
rejoice? O brittle Joy
How many ills? how fair a face?
and yet how much annoy
In the doth lurk, and hidden lies?
what heaps of endless strife?
They judge amiss, yt deame ye Prince
to have the happy life.
For as the mountains hog and hie,
the blustering winds withstand,
And craggy Rocks, the b•l•hinge fluds
do dash and beat fro land.
Though that the seas in queen•t are
and nought at all do some:
So kingdoms great submitted lye,
to Fortunes doulfull Dome.
How well shunt I my father dear
P•lybus scepters late?
Exiled• bereft of carfull fear,
in Pilgrims happy state.
I call the Gods to witness hear
and ••ars that glide in skies.
A kingdom is befallen to me,
I fear lest hereof rise
A mischief, (mighty Jove,) to great
I fear alas I fear
Lest these my hands have spoiled the life,
of the my father dear.
Appollo bids me this beware,
and yet a mischief more,
Foretells. Can any greater be
then this I told before?
Of father slain by sons own hand?
My shivering limbs do shake
And all amassed quaking stand
at this unhappy Fate.
I am ashamed my des•niece foul,
at large to thunder out,
And openly to blase my fear.
my dreadful mind doth doubt.
Yet out it goes. Phebu• me bids
my mothers beds to fly.
As though that I her son with her,
incestuouslie should lie,
This fear and only this my drives
from fathers kingdoms great.
Not like a wandering Uacabounde
the ways unknown I beat,
But all mistrust•ull of my self
thy laws (O Nature) for to keep
I sought the means. Yet fear I still
and fear into my mind doth creape
Though cause of Dread not one I s•
yet fear and dread I all.
And scante in credit with my self,
I seek my fatal fall
(By Dome of doulful Destinies.)
For what should I suppose the cause?
A Plage that is so general
And Cadmus country wholly spoils
and spreds it self thorough all?
Should vs amongst so hog a heap
of plaged Bodies spare?
And we alone amongst the rest
reserved to mischiefs are?
O heavy hap. And bide we still
alone the spoil to see?
Of Cites great, of men, of beasts,
by plage that wasted be?
And thou amongst so many yls,
a happy life to lead,
Could once per•wade thy self (O wretch
without al fear or dread.
Of Phebus secret Judgements to,
and that in kings estate,
Thou, thou, infected hast the ayre,
in such a filthy rate.
Thou art the only cause of woe:
by the these evils rise,
By the to grave on such a sort,
this wretched people plies.
The fyry flaming frieng heate,
afflicted harts that wastes,
Is not relyued as wont it was
by cold and pleasant blasts.
The gentle western winds have left
with healthful puffs to blow,
And now the fiery Dog with blase
of boiling heate doth glow.
The Son in Leo burns so hot,
and so the earth doth broil,
That fluds and herbs are dried up,
and nought remains but soil,
So thoroughly schorcht and stewed with heate,
that moisture all is gon,
And now amongst so may fluds,
remains alas not one.
The places dry are only scene
the streams are drunken up.
And water that doth yet abide,
the sokyng Earth doth sup.
The Moon with clouds quite over cast,
all sadly forth she glides,
And dolfull darksome shades of night,
the whole world ouerhides.
No Star on high at all doth shyne
but all the Skies are covered,
With black and hellyke hew &amp; mis∣tie
stench, quite overshadowed.
The corn that wonted was to grow
and frutefully to spring:
Now to the voided Barnes nought else
but empty stalks doth bring.
No part of all our kingdom is,
fre from Destruction:
But all together run and rush,
to utter confusion.
The old men with the young (alas:)
the father with the child
The plage consumes. both man &amp; wife
all beasts both •am and wild
Are spoiled by the Pestilence.
No pomp at all remains,
That wonted was in Funerals,
to ease the mourners pains.
Alas this spoil of people made,
by Plage hath dried mine eyes.
And secretly within my breast,
the gre•fit boiling fries.
And that that wonted is to hap,
in most ex•rem•st ylls.
My tears are dry and glutting grief
my wretched breast it fills.
The crazed father bears the sons,
unto their dampish graves.
And after him with burden like,
the mother comes and raves.
And even lamenting as they stand
starcke ded down both they fall,
And mourners new in like estate,
for them and theirs they call.
Who likewise in the midst of all,
their toil and painful payne
Do drop into the grave they digd,
and so the place do gain
(That was prepared for others erst.)
A tomb is made for Noble men
fast on the people hies
And in their burdēs •ling. Nobility
all unregarded lies.
For lack of graves their bodies all
to ashes they do wast.
And so half burnt they leave thē there.
and home away for hast
They run• &amp; more they fetch• &amp; thē
fire, wood, grave, and all
Doth want. And down for very grief
the wretched mis•rs fall.
No prayers avail• No Art can help
this raging Pl•ge tappease:
For none almost is left alive
eche others grief to ease.
Before thine aulters here O God
my feeble hands I hold,
Requiring all my destinies,
at once with courage bold.
And that by death I may prevent,
my Country pressed to fall.
For this: and only this (O God)
Upon thy name I call.
Let me not be the last that dies.
The last that goes to Grave.
Graūt this. &amp; then (O mighty love)
My full request I •aue.
O cruel Gods unkind. O more
than thrice unhappy •ates.
That only me denied is,
that lights on all estates.
I mean a spedy death alas,
these evils to prevent:
Leave of thy blubbering tears
&amp; fly these kingdoms foiled O fool
With rotten plages and botches vile
and graves eche where dyspoilde.
All which diseases thou unhap∣pie
ge•te did bring with the.
Dispatch. away. Go hence. at least,
unto thy parents sty.
What boots it Sir these mischiefs (great)
with piteous plaints to aggreuate.
Stoutly to bear adversity,
is first for kings estate.
The more thy Reign is doubted of,
and when that cares do crush
Thy princely breast. thē ought ye most
to bear and bide the push.
It is no point of courage stout,
to fortune for to yield.
Nay from this breast reprocheful fear
hath ever been exiled.
Our manhood is not subject now,
to vain and peevish fears,
But evermore in eche assault,
it princely courage bears.
No not a thousand glistening swords
nor all the force of war,
Can once appal my countenance
nor yet my mind deter,
The very giant fire•• and hog
in fight withstand I dare.
Not Sphinx his crafty compassed words
could make me once to yield.
I saw him belching gubbes of blud
I vowed full well the field
That all to spatterd lay. With blud
and bones quite ouerhelde,
And when yt he on moūtaynes top
with mouth full hog to se.
Stood gaping all with greedy •awes
to feed and pray on me,
Oft fluttering with his fearful wings
and shaking oft his tail,
Began full like a Lion fierce
with threats me to assail.
Of whom straight way the Riddell I.
it rushed into mine ears
With roaring sound. his wings he claps
the Rock for hast he tears.
Desiring with my bowels still
to glut his greedy Jaws.
But this mine old practised head
his subtle question draws,
In pieces at the length dissolved.
And it asundre saws.
What makes you wish for death to late?
you might have died than.
As for reward of Sphinx destroyed
this kingdom to you came.
(•ou need no more thereof to talk)
The ashes of that Monster vile,
against vs doth rebel.
That vile misshapen loathsome Beast,
that raging Feend of Hell.
Is cause of all the plage that now,
on Thebane City lights.
N•w only this remains alone,
if Phebùs heavenly might,
Can any means invent for vs,
or way of mercy make:
Whereby these burning Plagues at length
may happily chaūce to slake,
(that thus our people wastes.)
O More then thrice renowned stock
of aunciēt Cadmus race.
O mighty Thebes City great,
(O heavy ruthful Case.)
Lo now you lye all desolate,
with Plagues devoured quite.
Both you and all your Husbandmen.
(Oh miserable sight.)
O foul and fearful fates (alas)
what causes all this wo?
O God whence springs this Pasty∣lence?
that vs torments so?
No age, no shape, no form is spared•
but all confounded lye.
Thus happiest now yt man I count,
whose chance was first to dye•
For he hath shunt a thousand yls,
which wretched eyes have seen:
And mischiefs great that vs do prese
from him are taken clean.
O God withhold thy fury great,
thy Plages from vs remove.
Cease of afflicted Souls to scourge,
who the both serve and love.
Power down on thē diseases foul,
that them deserved have.
A Guerdon just for sin (Oh god)
this this of the we crave,
And only this. we ask no more
the cause and all is thine,
A thing not used of gods it is
from pity to decline.
My hart doth pant and trembling cold
through all my limbs doth run
As oft as I remembering count
the noble stocks vndun,
By death and dolfull destinies
that overwhelmed lye,
And yet alas the people still
to grave do faster hye.
In lunge Array all in a rank
by thousands on a Row,
On every side in every streate
to burial fast they go.
An hundred broad wide open gates,
are not enough for way,
But thronged the people pestered stand
still in a fearful staye,
And in the midst of al their toil
with corses on their backs,
The number that before doth po•st
the hinder number slackes.
The corses in the streets do lye
and grave on grave is made,
But all in vain. for nought it boots
the plage cannot be stayed.
The sacrifices donne to Gods
have to to ill success,
And such strange sights &amp; signs do rise
that nought else I can ges•
But that at hand with gastlye paws,
is utter destruction,
With thousand ylls accompanied
and extreme confusion.
The sheep of rot by heaps as thick
as dogs do fall and dye,
And belching owt their wasted lungs
on ground do sprawling lye.
And I my self of late did see:
(a sight unseen before,)
As our high pressed stood sacrificing
at the Temple door,
And struck with grievous bludy wound
the golden horned Bull
When down with liveless lump he drops
and members made full dull.
And all ye wound wide bleding gapes
and black goord blud out spu•s.
And yet the blade vnsprinckled was.
The blood it boiling stues
And bubbles on the ground. Alas
When• do these things portend?
Oh mghty Io•e at length I pray,
some good and happy end.
At length withhold thy hand (O God)
and health unto vs send.
Nothing alas remains at all,
in wonted old estate,
But all are turned topsey down,
quite void and desolate.
The tyred Horse with labour long•
from back his burden tats,
And after on his Masters breast,
his liveless limbs he squats.
And all his parts in pieces crush.
The Beasts in field that bide
Unkept. Unknown ways &amp; paths
do range and ouerstrid•.
The Bull for lack of food and meat
in field all fainting lies,
And all his flock dispersed quite,
the sly Shepherd dyes.
And there amongst the Heifers fierce
his fatal breath expyers,
The Harts without all fear of Wolves
do live in wretched peace,
The very wrathful roaring sounds,
of ramping Lyons cease.
The vengeance wild outrageous Bears
are now as tame as sheep
The ugly Serpent that was wont,
the Rocky Dens to keep.
Oft quassyng poisoned Uenom soups
in inward heate she boils.
And all inflamed and schorcht: in vain
for longer life she toils.
The woods are not adorned now,
with fresh and lively hue,
The wonted shades are gon. Al things
are quite out of their Que.
No grass on ground doth grow.
The earth no moisture soupes,
The Vine withou•en any sap,
his drowsy head down drowpes.
When• shall I say? all things (alas)
are writhen out of course,
And as they seem to me, are like,
to fare styll worse and worse.
O mighty God aboue? when end
these euerduryng yls?
When ceasthes• Plages? that gyltles blud
thus fierce and raging spiels?
I think but we almost alive,
there do no men remain:
Whom dolfull Darts of Destinies,
on earth have l•ft unslain.
I think the darcksom shades of hell
where filthy fluds do flow,
Where plages and vile diseases to
where dreadful horrors grow,
And all the furies brasten loose
do mischiefs on vs throw,
With botch &amp; blown of sundry kinds
which sothern blasts do blow,
And wreakful vexed hags of hell
do breathe and on vs bring
The angry fendes of hell I think
their vengeaūce on vs slinge
And out their mortal poison spue
which they against vs bear.
Lo see how greedy death on vs
with scowling eyes doth lear.
See see. Oh Jove how fast he throws
his Darts. Not one he spares
But al cōfownds. His threatening force,
with stand no Creature dares.
No doubt the loathsome Feryman
the sinful souls that trains
Through stinking fluds. his labour loths
that he for vs sustains.
Such press by plumps to him is made
which still renews his pains.
But hark yet mōsters more thē these
the fame abroad doth fly
That hellish dogs with Bawling sound
were herd to howl &amp; cry,
And yt the ground with trēbling shook,
and under fete did move.
And dreadful blazing Comets bright
were seen in Skies aboue.
And ghastly shapes of men besides,
to wander on the ground.
And wood and trees on every side,
Did fearfully resound.
Besides all this straūge ghosts were seen
in places where they stood.
And rivers more then one or two,
that ran all black goord blud.
O cruel plage. O vile disease,
far worse then spedy death.
O we unhappy thrice and more,
who do prolong our breath.
In thease accursed days and times.
But hark to me a while.
When first this loathsome plage begins
these misers to defile,
It takes them thus. A fearful Cold
through al their bones doth run,
And Cold and Heate together mixed,
their senses all benome.
Than little loathsome marks appear,
and all their bodies spot.
And al the members flaming glows,
and burning fast do rot.
The Lights, the Lungs, the hart, the Guts,
and all that in ward li•s.
And all the secret parts Iscorcht,
with deadly fire fries.
The blood al clotterd in their cheks,
in cluster lies by lumps.
And it and heat together makes,
great strange and ruddy bumps.
And blud and flesh congealed stands,
in face as stiff as stake.
And •yes in head fast fixed set,
and often trickling make.
And down apace whole fluds they steam,
and clots &amp; drops do tril
And al the skin from of their face,
by flakes and scales doth pill.
A thousand fearful sounds at once,
into their ears do rush.
And loathsome blud out of their nose,
by stilling streams doth gush.
The very anguish of their hart,
doth cause them for to shake.
And what with Pain &amp; Heat &amp; Fear,
their wearied limbs do quake.
Then some the rōning Rivers haunt,
and some on ground do wallow.
And some again their thirst to s•ache,
cold water gulping swallow.
Thus all our country tossed with Plage
in Grief it weltering lies.
And still desiring for to die,
A thousand deaths i• dyes.
But God them then to hear is pressed,
And death to none denies.
Besides all this, the church some do
frequent: but not to pray.
But only for to glut the Gods,
with that that they do say.
But who is this yt comes from Court
in hast with posting pace?
What is it Croon that Noble blood?
commended for his grace
(Of all that live.)
Or doth, my crazed mind oppressed.
things false for true conceive,
Tic Croon long desired for.
His sight doth me relieve.
FOr fear my body chilles alas
and trembling all I stand
Inquaking dred. I seek &amp; toil
these mischiefs to with stand.
But all in vayn I labour I
it will not bee I see.
As lunge as mere repugnaunts thus
together m•xed bee.
My mind desirous still (Oh god,)
the truth for so unfold.
With doubtful Dred is daunted so,
that it can scante up hold.
(It self.)
O brother dear if any means.
or way of health thou know.
Declare it out and stick not now.
the truth to me to show,
Sir if it pleas your noble grace,
the answers hidden lies.
Who doubtful health to sick mē brings
all health to them denies.
Appolloes use it is the truth
with darksome shades to dusk.
And Oedipus of gods it hath,
things doubtful to discus.
Speak out and spare not man.
The mighty God commands.
To purge the Princes seat forth•ith
and that straight out of hand
That villayn vile requited be,
with plages and vengeance due.
Who fierce with blody hands of late,
my brother Laíus slue.
Before that this performed be,
no hope of milder air.
Wherefore do this O king. or else,
of hope and health dispaier.
Durst any man on earth attempt,
that noble prince to slay?
Show me ye slave that I may him,
dispatch out of the way.
God grant the sight be good (Alas•)
the heringe is to terrible.
My senses all amassed stand,
it is a thing so horrible.
That I abhor to speak my mind,
Oh god for fear I quake.
And even at the very thought
my limbs begin to shake.
As soon as I Appollos Church,
had entered in afraid.
Upon my face flat down I foul.
And thus to him I prayed.
Oh God if ever thou did rue,
on wretched misers state.
If ever men oppressed thou easd,
or did their cares abate.
If ever thou in present Need:
did present Help declare.
If ever thou afflicted Harts,
with Cares consumed did spare.
Now show thy dreadful force (O God)
show now thy mighty pore.
Scant had I said: Resounding all
the mountains thundering roar.
And filthy Feends spout out their flames
out of their darksome caves.
And woods do quake. &amp; Hills do move
and up the surging waives
Do mount unto the skies aloft.
And I amassed stand.
Still looking for an answer at
Appollos sacred hand.
When out with ruffled hear disguised
the Prophet coms at last.
And when that she had felt the heat,
of mighty Phebus blast.
All puffing out she swells in rage,
and pattring still she raves,
And scante she entered had into,
Appollos shining caves,
Whē out a thūd•ing voice doth burst
Thats far aboue mans reach.
So dreadful seemed then to me,
the mighty Ph•bu• speech.
Than thus he spake &amp; thus at length,
into mine ears he rushed.
While sprawling still ye Prophet lay
before the doors in dust.
The Thebane City• never shall,
be free from Plagues, (quoth he,)
Except from thence the King queller
forthwith expulsed be.
Unto Apollo known he was,
or ever he was borne,
Do this: or else no hope of h•alth,
to this, the G•ds have sworn.
And as for him, he shall not long,
in queen•t ••at• endure:
But with himself, wage War he shall.
and War he shall procure
Unto his Children dear. And cre•pe
again he shall,
into his Mothers womb•.
Loke what ye gods comaūded hau•
accomplished shall be.
Nor never shall these eyes of mine
abide the day to see.
A king of kingdom spoiled by force:
by guile and craft suppressed.
A king to kings the prop ought be,
and chiefest cause of rest.
No man regards his death at all
whom living he doth fear,
Great cause makes me my princes death
concele and closely bear.
(In mind.)
Ought any cause of fear or grief,
thy duty for to let.
The threatening of the Prophesies,
do still my breast beset.
As gods have wild vs for this mis∣chief
mends now let vs make.
If any way or means there be,
their suries for to slake.
Thou God yt sits in Seat on high,
and all the world dost guide
And thou by whose commandment,
the stars in skies do glide.
Thou thou that only ruler art,
of seas and fluds and all.
On the and on thy Godhed great,
for these requests we call.
Who so hath slain king Laius
Oh I•ue I do the pray.
Let thousand else upon him fall,
before his dienge day.
Let him no health, no comfort have,
bu• al to crushed with cares,
Consume his wretched years in grief
and though yt Death him spares
A while. Yet mischiefs all at once,
at length upon him light.
With all the evils under son,
that ugly Monster smight.
In exile let him live a slave,
the rated course of life.
In Shame, in Care, in penury,
in Danger and in strife.
Let no man on him pity take,
let all men him revile.
Let him his mothers sacred Beds
incestuouslye defile.
Let him his father kill. And yet
let him do mischiefs more.
(what thing more heinous can I wish
then that I wished before.)
Let him do all those ills I say,
that I have shunt and past.
All those and more (if more may be,)
oh God upon him cast.
Let him no hope of pardon have:
but sue and all in vayn.
All hellish Furies on him light,
for to increase his pain.
Oh love power down thy fury great.
thy thundering thumps out throw.
Let Bores boisterous blasts &amp; stor∣my
Plages upon him blow.
Consume him quite. Fret out his guts
with Pockes &amp; botches vile.
Let all Diseases on him light,
that wretched bodies fyle.
Let these and more (if more may be,)
upon that Monster fall.
Let Harpies Paws &amp; greedy paunch:
devour his members all.
Let no man him regard: or seek
his limbs in grave to lay.
But let him dye ten thousand deaths
before his dieng day.
By this my kingdom I do swear,
and kingdom that I left,
By al my Country Gods that ben
in Tempels close I kept•
I swear, I vow, I do protest,
and thereto witness take:
The Stars, the Seas, the Earth, &amp; all
that ere thy hand did make.
Except that I my self forthwith
this bludy Monster find
To wreak the wrath of God some way
with solemn Oath I bind.
And so my Father Polibu•,
his happy days outlive.
And so my Mother M•••p•,
no Marriage new contrive:
As he shall dye that did this dede.
And none shall him excuse.
What soever that he be I swear:
for that he shortly rues.
But where this wicked dede was don
Croon now tell me plain?
By•h by what means? &amp; where? and how?
King Laius was slain.
Passing through Castalia woods,
and Mountains heaped with Snow
Where G•os of scrubs &amp; Bushes thick
&amp; Brambels sharp do grow.
A three pathde crooked way there is,
that diversely doth go.
O•e unto Bac•hus City bends,
that Phocia doth hight:
The other to the Land of Sis•phus
forth stretches out a right.
The third at the end whereof,
a loathsome Serpent lies,
Tends down unto the Bank whereby
Eleia water plies.
The are minding nought but peas,
a soden band o• th•ues.
By open force of Arms outright,
this mischief• great contrives.
But lo as well as can be coms,
Tiresi•• with trembling pace.
I think Appollos heavenly might,
hath brought him to this place.
Se where he comes and Man•o t•.
his ways directing goes.
COme holy priest to Phebus next
these doubtful answers lose.
And whom ye destnies will to die.
Straight ways to me disclose,
Renowned Prince though still I stand
in silence doom dismayed.
And though by inward fear of mind
my lingering tongue is stayed.
•et pardon me (O •oble Prince,)
and give me leave a while.
From •a•k of sight •prings Ignorance
which power hath to exile,
Unspot••d True•h frō doubtful br•sts.
This thing full well you know,
But whither god &amp; Country calls,
with willing mind I go.
Let deadly fatal destinies,
be bolted out at length.
O king if I of greener years,
had now my wonted strength
This matter soon discussed should be,
and I wold take in hand.
My self in presence of the Gods,
in temple for to stand.
A mighty Ox all coloured white,
up on the Aultars rear.
Which never yet on wearied neck,
the Crooked yoke did bear.
And Manto thou O daughter mine,
mine only prop and staye.
The secret hidden mysteries,
and sacred signs out say.
The best before the Aultare stands.
To Gods a solemn prayer make.
And on the holy Aultars to,
some pleasant odours shake.
Tic don. And all the fierce fierce,
with incense bright do flame.
O Manto now what signs see thou?
how do thy matters frame?
What doth the fire, the Sacrifice,
encompass round about?
Not so. But first it mounts aloft,
and straight it flashes out.
Well. Yet, how doth the sacred flame
all shining bright and clear
Hit self on high unto the skies,
with sparkling flakes vpr•are?
Or doth it oft r•bounding back,
hit self, from skies unfold?
Or all with rumbling roaring noise,
about the place first rolled?
Or mi•t with smoke first tossed frō place.
to place now here now theare?
Not all one but mingled colours,
the flame doth with it bear.
Much like unto the Rainbow,
which having soundry hues,
Doth show unto the husbandmen,
the whether that ensues.
What colour it wants: or what it hath
to me is like uncertain.
Now is it black, now blue, now red,
and even now again
Quite out it is. Yet once again,
all fierce it flashing flames.
But lo yet mi•chiefs more then this,
unluckily it frames.
The fire quite asounder parts,
and flame with flame doth fight.
O father I abhor to see,
this ugly lothes•m sight.
The wine to blud is turned quite,
and all the Princes head.
With thick black clouds encōpast is,
with smoke all over spread.
O father tel what this portends?
What should I tell alas?
My mind for fear astonished stands,
and trembling cold doth pas
Through all my limbs. What shall I say?
or where shall I begin?
O cruel Plages O wreakful Gods,
O vengeance due for sin.
Some horrible mischief great, alas,
these fearful signs declare.
(O Iupiter)
whats that y• Gods wold have reveled
and yet do bid beware.
(To utter it,)
They are ashamed: I know not what.
Come hither quickly bring.
Some salt with the. Go it upon
the wounded he•fer fling.
Howe now? Dost once resistance make,
or do•th it gently bide
The touching of thy sacred hands.
His head on high he lifts.
And torning t• the East, by course
from thence he often shifts
Still loathing as he seems to me,
Of heaven to see the light,
Oft scowling with his blearing eyes
with gastely ruthefull sight.
What? Doth one blow them drive to groūd
or more then one they have.
The heifer as it seemed inflamed,
with cou•age stout and brave
Upon the mortal Blade did rush,
and there himself destroys.
When out the blud it foaming spouts,
and mounts unto the Skies.
The bull twice stroke or thrice,
with grovelling groaning tyres.
And toiling up and down he moyles.
and still to live desires.
And yet at length with much ado,
his brutish breath expiers.
What? doth ye wound wide opē gape,
or is it closed up?
Or doth the depnes of the hole.
the blot in soking supp.
Out of the wounded Heifers breast,
black bluish waters rush.
And from his nose and eyes, &amp; mouth,
whole streams, of •lute do gush.
By this unhappy Sacrifice,
great fears within me rise.
But tell me now: In the inner parts.
what secrets hidden lies?
O father what means this? the in∣wards,
moore than w•ntyd guise.
Do move &amp; stir, and shake my hands,
and heaving oft do rise.
The blud by streams out of the veins,
full strayngely skyppes aloft.
The hart all schorcht &amp; hidden lies,
and strikes are seen full oft,
Of Colour very wan and pale.
The chiefest parts do want.
The liver blackish gaull out spurts,
and somewhat rising pants.
And that that myscheyfs great,
to kingdoms doth forshow:
A little loathsome piece of Skin,
the hart doth overgrow.
And ouerwhelms it quite. Where∣through,
a man may easly see,
How both the hart the lights, &amp; lūgs,
And all disturbed bee,
No part his proper place observes,
or keeps his ordre due:
But altogether quite disguised,
with an unwonted hue.
Misshapen out of frame, trance•ormd,
displaced quite. Alas.
I fear, I fear, some ill success
in this unhappy cas.
Declare from whence and why,
these fearful Signs do rise,
With courage stout I will it hear,
it shall not once aggryse
My valiant mind. Extremest yls
have power to banish fear:
You will wysh yt vnhard which you
so much desire to hear.
Tell me I say, since that the Gods
will have it to be known.
Tell me, what is his name that hath
king Laius overthrown?
No sacrifice will serve (O king)
new means must we invent:
From dreadful dark infernal damps:
some Fury must be sent
These mischiefs great for to unfold.
Or else king Ditis he,
That Empier keeps on Ghosts,
entreated needs must be
These things forthwt for to disclose.
Tell who shall have the charge,
A king thou art, than may not thou
go through those kingdoms large•
Than noble Croon thou shalt go,
this payne is first for the:
Who must this ancient kingdom great
enjoy after me.
THough that thy face with sadness clad,
in heavy morning guise:
Nought else portend: but deadly griefs
and mischiefs styll to rise.
Yet tell some means whereby at lēgth
the Gods we may appease,
And purchase to our kingdoms wast,
some hope of health and ease.
Alas you bid me that disclose,
which •ear doth bid me hyde.
If that the •hebane Cit•es great,
by doulfull Plags destroyed.
Do the not move. Yet ought thou,
these kingdoms for to rue•,
Which were unto thy brothers house,
of ancient title due.
You wish yt thing to know: which you,
will wish unknown at length.
To banish else: in Ignorance,
there rests no power nor strength.
Wilt thou in al these mischeyfs seek,
the truth for to suppres?
Where Cure of Care is to be lothd,
I seake not to redress.
Speak out with speade, or else I swear,
thou shalt by practyse prove,
How great a thing of weight it is,
a Princes mind to move.
Kings often use to wish untold.
Which they bad tell before.
Go to dispatch. Cease of I say,
to vere me any moore,
Except that thou furthwith thou wretch,
this matter do disclose,
The Gods I do protest for all,
to death thou only goes.
Pardon me O noble king.
give leave to hold my peas,
Of all the pardons Princes grant.
what pardon may be leas?
As though ye Silence hurts not more,
oftymes than words ill spent.
Dispatch at once: Stir me no more.
thou know my wonted Guise,
When Silence is denied: what than
remains that lawful is?
A traitor he is, that silence kepes
when he is bid to speak.
Constraynd I am. Receive my words
with gentell mind I pray.
Was ever man rebuked for that.
that he was bid to say?
Well than since neds I must: I am,
contented to obey.
A wood there is from City far,
encompassed thick with trees,
Where Rivers roar: &amp; winds do whirl
that stir the Stormy sees,
Where grows an aūcient Cypress tree
with crookyd bandied limbs,
With Stretching down his braūches old,
unto the water brims.
His euerduryng bushes greene,
which time did never breed,
With •auours sweet and comely moss,
doth largely overspread.
Amidst them all, a tree there is,
with lunge outstretched Arms:
Whose roaring sound, &amp; croaking nois•
the lesser woods Icharmes,
And ouershades them all. A tree
of monstrous hog estate,
Beset with fearful woods: here is
that dire, and dreadful gate,
That leads to loathsome Limbo Lake be¦neath,
And pits that ever flow.
Where choked miry mud doth stream
with slimy course full slow.
Here when the Priest was entered in,
with comely aged pace,
He stayed not: No need there was,
for night was styll in place.
Than all ye ground wide open gape•
and smothering vapours r•se,
And fire and smoke, &amp; stifling stink,
mounts up into the Skies.
The Priest with wailing weed, I clad
his fa•all rod out took:
And entering in, in black Array,
full often times it shook.
With heavy chere and dolfull pace.
His hoary hear was twinned
With Bows of mortal Ewe. A tree
wherewith the mourners wind,
Their mourning heads. &amp; Garlands make.
In this guise all arrayed,
The sacred Priest doth entry in,
with quaking limbs afraid.
Than in the sheep and Oxen black,
by backward course are drawn.
And odours sweet, &amp; Frankincense,
on flaming fires are thrown.
The Beasts on burning Altars cast,
do quake with schorched li•is:
And bluddy streams with fire mixed,
about the Aultars swims.
Than on the dark infernal Gods,
and him that rules them all:
With deadly shrieking voice aloud,
the Prophet gins to call.
And rolls the Magic verse in m•uth
and hidden Arts doth prove:
Which either power have to appease
or else the Gods to move.
Than bludy streaming lycours black
with broiling heate do boyle:
And al the Beasts consumes &amp; burns.
The Prophet than to toil
Begins. And mingled wine and milk
upon the Aultars throws.
And all the Dungeon dark, and wide
with streaming blood it flows.
Than out with thūdring voice again
the Prophet calls and cries.
And straight as much with mumbling mouth
he champs in secret wise.
The trees do turn. The Rivers stād
The ground with roaring shakes.
And all the world as seems to me,
with fearful trembling quakes.
I am heard, I am heard, than out a∣loud,
the Priest began to cry:
When all the dāpned souls by heaps
abroad outrushyng fly.
Then woods with rumbling noise,
do oft resounding make.
And Heaven, &amp; Earth together goes.
And bows &amp; trees do croak.
And Thūders roore. And Lightnings flash.
And waives aloft do fly.
And ground retires: And Dogs do bawl
And Ghosts are herd to cry.
And whither long of Acheron,
that loathsome Flood that flows.
All stinking streams: or of y• earth,
that out her Bowels throws,
Dead Corpses to receive. Or of
that fierce infernal Hound
That at such times doth bustling make
with chains, &amp; rattling sound.
The Earth all wide it open gapes.
And I did se on ground,
The Gods with colour pale and wan,
that those dark kingdoms keep.
And very night I saw in dede.
And thousand shapes to creep,
From out those filthy stinking lakes
and loathsome pits of Hell.
Where all the e•yls under Son,
in darksome shades do dwell.
So quaking all for fear I stood,
with mind right sore apalde,
Whilst on those Gods with trembling mouth
the Priest full often called.
Who all at once, out of their dens
did skip with grisly face.
And Mōsters grim, &amp; stinging snakes
seemed wander in that place.
And all the foulest Feends of Hell,
and Furies all were there.
And al trāsformed Ghosts &amp; sprights,
that ever Hell did bear.
With Cares, and all Diseases vile,
that mortal minds do crush,
All those, and more I saw out of
those Dongeons deep to rush.
And Age I saw, with rifled face,
and Need, and Fear, and Death,
And Fire, and flames, &amp; thousand yls
out fro those Pits to breath.
Then I was gon: and quite amazed.
The wench in worser cas.
And yet of old, acquainted with
her Fathers Arts she was.
The Priest himself vnmoued stood,
and boldly cited owt:
Whole Armies of king Ditis men,
who clustering in a Rowt:
Al flittring thin like Clouds, dispersed
abroad in Ayre do fly.
And breathing oft with divers forms,
do scud aboue in Sky.
A thousand woods I think have not,
so many leaves on trees.
Ten thousād meadows fresh have not
so many swarming Bees.
Ten hundred thousand Hills have not
so many flakes of Snow.
Nor all the drops &amp; streams, &amp; gulffs
that in the Seas do flow.
If that they might be weighed, can once
so great a number make,
As could those shapes &amp; forms yt flew
from out of Limbo lake.
Both Tan•alus and Zetus to,
and pale Amphions Ghost:
And A••u•, and after her,
ten thousand Sprights do post.
Than Penti•eus and more and more,
in like estate ensue:
Till out at length coms La•us:
with foul and grisly hue.
All perst with wounds, I loath to speak
with blud quite overgrown:
Uncomely dressed, in wretched plight,
with head styll hanging down.
A Miser right as seemed to me,
and most of Misers all:
Thus in this case, at length he spake,
and thus began to call.
O Cadmus cruel City vile,
that styll deligh•st in blood,
O Cadmus thou, which kinsmens death,
acowntst as chiefest good.
Tear out the bluddy Bowels of
your Children. Learn of me,
Do that, &amp; rath•r more: than you
wold bide the day to se.
Like yls as late on me are light.
Lo Mothers love, (Alas)
Is now, the rifest fault outright
that ere in Theba was.
The Coūtrye with the wrath of gods
at this time is not tossed.
Nor Earth nor Ayre infect is not
the cause that all ben lost.
No. No. A bluddy king is cause
of all these mischiefs great.
A bluddy wretch. A wretched Child
that sits in Fathers Seat.
And Mothers bed defiles (O wretch)
and entered in again,
In places whence he came frō once
and doubles so her payne.
And that, that very Beasts almost,
do all abhor to do:
Even of his Mothers body he,
hath brothers gotten too.
(O mischief great,) (O dreadful dede)
than Sphinx, O Monster more.
Example unto Ages all,
of Gods foretold before.
But I thee, thee ye Sceptre holdst,
thy Father will pursue:
And wreak my self on the and thine,
with fearful vengeance due.
All raging Plagues, all Botches vile
I will upon the blow.
And all the foulest Feends of Hell,
upon the I will throw.
I will subvert thy Houses clean,
for this thy loathsome lust.
I will do this, thou wretch. And the
and thine, consume to dust.
Wherefore dispatch at once (I say)
into exile drive your King.
That groūd that first of all he leaves
with fresh greene grass shall spring
And swe•e and pleasant Ayre,
and healthful blasts shall blow.
And all the evils under the Son,
that beastly slave shall follow.
The Poks, ye Piles, ye Botch, ye blown
and Death with him shall fly.
And with him mischiefs all shall pas,
and Monsters under Sky.
And as for him I know he wold
depart with willing mind:
But I will clog his feet and hands,
his way he shall not find.
But groping with his aged staff,
shall pass from place to place.
This shall he do. And none shall rue
upon his wretched case.
Rid you him from the earth in tim•
for Heaven let me alone:
No sooner said, bu• straight away,
his dreadful Ghost was gone.
And fast by thousands after him,
tother Sprights in hyde:
Than Cold &amp; trembling fear began
through all my bones to glide.
That, that I always feared, alas
upon me now is laid:
But slender props they are (God wot)
whereby your Treason is stayde.
Mer•pa my Mother dear,
shall me from this defend.
And Polibus shall purge me quite,
from Actions all that tend
To muter, or to incest vile,
they both shall me excuse.
In such a case no means at all
of trial I refuse.
Lay what you can unto my charge.
No fault in me remains.
The Thebanes long or I cam here,
of La•us death complains.
My mother yet alive, my Fa∣there
styll in like estate.
No, no, this is some do••ysh dryf•,
of you false Prophets pate.
Or else some mighty God aboue,
doth bear vs no good will,
And seeks by Plages on vs to wreak,
his wrathful vengeance styll.
A sir I am glad, at length I smell
your drifts and fetches fine:
I know the whole confedrats well
your sleyghts I can untwine.
That beastly Priest. That blearcyed wretch
be lies the Gods and me:
And thee thou Traitor in my place
hath promised king to be.
Alas wold I my sister of,
her lawful kingdom spoil?
Think you such Treason may have place
in brothers breast to boyle?
If that mine Oath could me not keep
content with my degree:
But that contemning mean estate,
I wold clime aloft to be.
Yet should ill Fortune me deter,
from such attempts I trow:
Whose guise it is on Princes heads,
hog heaps of Cares to throw.
I wold advise you sir betimes•
this charge from you to threst:
Least lingering long with it at length,
unawares ye be oppressed.
Assure your self, in baser state,
more safer you may live:
And shun a thousand Cares &amp; Griefs:
which Princes Harts do rye•e.
And dost thou me exhort thou slave
my kingdoms for to leave?
Dare tho• attempt thou villain vile
this thing to me to break?
And fear thou not in such a case
so boldly for to speak.
Thynk you I wold them so persuade
which freely might posses
Their Realms? Or those yt need not fear
least cares should thē oppress.
But as for you, of force you must,
your Fortunes change abide:
The surest way for them that gape,
for kingdoms large and wide:
Is first things mean, and rest
and base estate to praise:
And yet with tooth &amp; Nail to toil,
to mount aloft always.
So oftentimes most restless Beasts,
do chiefly rest cōmende.
Shall not my Service long suffice,
my truth for to defend?
Time is the only means for such,
as thou to work, their will.
It is so sir. But as for me,
of goods, I have my fill.
A great resort. A pleasant life:
from Princely Cares, exempt.
Al these might m• dissuade (O king)
from such a foul attempt.
Not one day there is almost,
the whole year throughout:
Wherein some Royal Gifts are not,
unto my Houses brought.
Both precious Pearls, and princely Roobs
and things of gr•ater cost:
Which I let p•sse, lest I should seem
but vainly for to bossed.
In such a blessed hap•y state,
what thing need I require?
The more you hast, I know right well,
the more thou dost desire:
Good fortune can no mean observe,
but styll she prea•eth hyer.
Shall I than gyltles dye Alas,
my cause and all untried•?
Were unto you at any time
my life, my deeds descried?
Did any man defend me y•t?
or else my causes pl•ade?
And yet I am condemned. To this
you do me lead.
And me express example give
which I entend to follow:
What if that Innocent I be:
The guise of kings you know
Is doubtful things for true to fear
if thence may mischief grow.
The often fearful trembling mind,
true cause of fear doth show.
He that in midst of perils deep,
and dangers hath ben cast,
Doth seek all means to shun like yls
as he hath overpassed.
So hatreds rise.
He that to much
doth use ill will to fear,
Unskilful is: and knows not how,
he ought him self to bear
In kings estate. For fear alone
doth Kingdoms chiefly keep.
Than he that thus doth arm himself
from fear all free may sleep.
Who so the Tyrant plays and gilt∣les
men with force doth smight:
He dredeth them that him do dred
thus fear doth chiefly light.
On Causers chief A just revenge,
for murdering minds outright.
Away with this Traitor. Away.
In Dungeon deep him cast:
There let his vile deceitful mind
due pains and vengeance taste
For his deserved yls. Let there
dire bondage him constrain:
Bondage the chiefest scourge of mind
that Traitors can sustain.
SEE, see, the miserable estate,
of Princes careful life.
What raging storms? what bludy broils
what toil? what endless strife
Do they endure? (O God) what plags?
what grief do they sustain?
A Princely life: No. No. (No doubt)
An ever during payne.
A state en fit for men on whom
Fortune would wreak her will.
A place for Cares to couch them in.
A door wide open styll
For griefs and dangers all that ben
to entry when they list.
A king these Mates must ever have,
it boots not to resist.
Whole fluds of privy pinching fear.
great a•guysh of the mind:
Apparent Plages, &amp; deyly griefs.
These playsayres Princes find.
And other none, with whom they spend
and pass their wretched days.
Thus he that Princes li•es, and base
estate together ways:
(Shall find the one,)
A Dungeon deep. A very Hell.
A perfect infelicity.
(The other,)
A Heaven right: A blessed life,
exempted quite from misery.
Let O•dipus Example be
of this unto you all,
A Mirror meet. A Pattern plain,
of Princes careful thrall.
Who late in perfect Joy as seemed,
and everlasting bliss,
Triumphantly his life out led,
a Miser now outright he is,
And most of wretched Misers all,
even at this present time,
With doubtful waives of fear I to••,
Subject to such a Crime.
Whereat my tong •mased stay•s,
God grant that at the last,
It fall not out as 〈◊〉 told•.
Not yet the worst is past,
(I fear.)
MY mind with doubtful waives of fear,
is tossed to and fro
I wot not what to say. Alas
I am tormented so.
For all the Gods on me do cry,
for pains and vengeance dew,
They say yt these my gyltles hands,
king Laius overthrew.
But this my valiant Courage stout,
and mind from mischief free,
To Gods untried, to me well known
denies it so to bee.
Full well I do remember once,
by chance I did dispatch,
A man: who sought by force with me,
presumptuously to match.
And sought by force me to displace,
as much as in him lay.
This I remember well enough,
the strife was for the way.
And he a man of aged years,
and I a lusty blood.
And yet of me are disdain and pride,
in vain he me withstood.
But this from Thebes far was don.
A crooked three pathd way:
That was ye place for which we strove
this I remember well,
Dear wife resolve my dout at once
and me expressly tell•
How old was La•us when he died,
of fresh and lusty years?
(Or was he stricken well in age?)
Betwixt an old man and a young:
but nearer to an old.
Were there great Bands of men with him
his Person to uphold?
Some by the way deceived were.
And some deterd by payne.
A few by toil and labour long,
did with their Prince remain.
Were •ny slain in his defence?
But one of whom I here:
Who valiant in his Princes cause,
full stoutly did expier.
It is enough I know him now,
that hath this mischief done.
The nombre and the place agrees.
The time untried alone
Remains. Than tell what time he died
and when that he was slain.
Tic ten year since: You now renew
the cause of all my payne.
THe Corinth people all (O king)
do call for you to reign,
In your own kingdoms.
eternal rest obtain.
O God what Fortune vile doth me doth
oppress on every side?
How do my sorrows styll increase?
Tell how my father did.
No one disease but only Age,
did of his life him reeve.
And is he dead in dede? Not slain?
What joy may I conceive?
How may I now triumph? The Gods
to wy•nes I do call,
To whō are known my hidden thou∣ghts
&amp; secret workings all.
Now may I lift to Skies my hands,
my hands from mischief free.
But yet the chiefest cause of fear,
remains styll to me.
Your Fathers Kingdoms ought all dred
out of your mind to wear.
Tha• I confess. But wretched beast,
my Mother I do fear.
Do you your Mother fear? on your
return that only stays.
I fear not her: but from her sight
my godly Zeal me frays.
What will you her a Widow leave?
Now, now, thou woundst my hart.
This, this, and only this alas,
is cause of all my smart.
Tell me (O king) what •ou•full fear!
doth pre••e thy Princely breast:
Kings Cowncels I can well concele
that ben with Cares oppressed.
Least as Apollo hath foretold,
I should a Marriage make
With mine own Mother: •nly this
foul fear doth make• me quake.
Such vayn &amp; pe•ysh fears, at lēgth
from out your breast e•yle.
Me•open your Mother is not in dede,
you do your self beguile.
What vantage should it be to her
adopted Sons to have?
A kingdom she shall gain thereby.
Her Husband laid in grave.
The chiefest prop to stay her Realms
from present Confusion,
Is Children for to have: and hope
of lawful succession.
Tell me ye means whereby thou dost,
these Secrets understand?
It was I that you an Infant gave
into your fathers hand.
Did thou me to my Father give?
Who than gave me to thee?
A Shepherd sir, that wonted on
C•thero• Hills to bee.
What made thee in those woods to range
what had you there to do?
Upon those Hills my Beasts I kept,
sometime a Shepherd to.
What notes, what privy marks hast •thou
whereby thou dost me know?
The hols yt thrugh your feet are bored
frō whence your name did grow.
Declare what was his name yt gave
my body unto thee?
The Kings chief Shepherd thā yt was
delivered you to me.
What was his name?
Old men's
remembrance soon doth fail:
Oblivion for the chiefest part,
doth hory heads assail
And drowns their former memory
of things long out of mind.
What? can you know the man by sight?
Perhaps I should him find,
and know by face. Thīgs ouerwhelmd
by time, and quite oppressed.
A small mark oft to mind revokes,
and fresh renues in breast.
Sirs bid ye Herdmen furthwith drive
their Beasts to Aultars all.
Away with speed, make hast the Mas∣la
Shepherds to me call.
Whither thy Destinies this do hyde
or Fortune it detain,
And closely keep: Let it be s•,
from opening that refrain.
That long concealed hath hidden lien
that seake not to disclose:
Such things outsercht &amp; foūd of∣times
against the searcher goes.
Can any mischief greater be?
than this that now I fear.
Advise you well remember first
what weight this thing doth bear:
That thus you go about to search,
and sift with tooth and nail,
Observe the golden mean: Beware
bear styll an equal sail.
Your Coūtreies wealth, O king your life,
and all upon this lies.
Though you stir not, be sure at lēgth
your Fortune you escryes.
A happy state for to disturb
doth nought at all behove.
When things be at the worst of them
a man may safely move.
Can you have ought more excellent?
than is a Princes state?
Beware least of your Parents found
i• you repent to late.
No, no, I warrant that? Repent?
not I, I trow:
I seek it not to that intent.
I have decreed to know,
The matter at the full. Wherefore
I will it now pursue.
Lo Phorhas where he trembling coms,
with comely aged hue.
To whom of all the kings flock than,
the •are and charge was due.
Dost y• his name, his sp•ache, his face,
or y•t his person know?
Me thynks I should have seen his face
and yet I can not show
(The places where:)
This look is nether thrughly known
nor yet unknown to me
I can not tell. I doubt it much.
And yet it may be he.
In L••u• time long since when he,
these Kingdom• great did keep:
Wast you not on Citheron Hills?
chief Shepherd to his sheep.
Sometime a charge of shep I had
unworthy though I wear
And on those Hills long since chief rule
on •there Shepherds bare.
Know you not me.
I can not tell.
Did you once give this man
A Child• Speak out, why dost thou staye?
if so, declare it than.
Why dost you blush &amp; doubting stand
Truth seeks no delay?
Things out of mind you bid revoke
almost quite worn away.
Confess thou slave, or else I •wear,
thou shalt constrained be.
In dede I do remember once,
an Infant young by me,
Delivered was unto this Man:
But well I wot in vayn,
I know he could not long endure,
nor yet alive remain.
Long since he is dead, &amp; rakte in dust,
he lives not at this day.
No? God forbid, he lives no dowt,
and long may live I pray.
Why dost thou say the Child you gave
is dead and rakte in dust?
Because that through his tender feet.
an Iron sharpe was thrust:
Whereof a gr•uous swelling rose,
I saw the blood to gush
Frō out of both the wounds: &amp; down
by pouring streams to rush.
Now staye (O king) no farther now,
you know almost the troth.
Whose child was it? tell me forthwt.
I dare not for mine Other.
Thine Other y• slave. Some fire here.
Isle charm thine Other &amp; the,
With fire and flames: except forthwt
thou tell this thing to me.
O pardon me, though rude I seem,
I seek not to withstand
Your Graces mind: and will not I.
My life is in your hand.
Tel me the troth, what child, &amp; whose
what was his Mothers name?
Borne of your wife and brough.
O Earth burst out and gape for me,
devour my body quite,
Or else thou God, that Ruler art
of Houses void of light.
To Hell my Soul with Thunder bolts
to Hell my soul down drive.
Where furious Ghosts in darkness deep
and endless payne do live.
For the alone, these Plages do rage•
For the these mischiefs rise.
For thee, the Earth lies desolate.
For the thou wretch the Skies
Infected are. For the, for the,
and for thy filthy lust,
A hundred thousand gyltles men,
consumed are to dust.
O people throw: cast heaps of stones
upon this hateful Head:
Bathe all your Blades within my Guts
Show pity none. Proceed.
Against me vile transform•d Beast
with pains and vengeance due.
Let Father, Son, and wife, and all,
with Weapons me pursue.
Let those that for my sake alone,
with Plages tormented be
Throw Darts. Cast Spears: Fling stones
&amp; flaming Bronds on me.
O Slave. O filthy vacabound.
O hateful head of thine.
Confownder O of Nature thou,
to godly Laws divine.
Even from thy birth an open foe.
Go to, dispatch, and dye.
Thou hast deserved Death. Go, go,
unto the Court the hye.
Therewith thy mother slave triumph
Rejoice as thou may do:
Which hast thy House increased with unhappy Children so.
Make haste with speed, away, some thing
thy mischiefs worthy find.
And on thy self wreak all the spite
of thy revenging mind.
FOrtune ye Dame of presēt lief
doth all things chaūge at will
&amp; stirring still, procures grief
such misers minds to fill.
Which careful are their states to keep
when boisterous storms do rise,
And blustering winds &amp; daūgers deep
sets Death before their •yes.
Who saith he doth her fawning feel!
and changes not his mind,
Whē fickle flight of Fortunes wheel
doth turn by course of kind.
These greu•us Plags frō private house
to Princely Thrones do flow.
And oft their minds with •ares they fosse
and thick upon them strew.
Whole heaps of grief &amp; dire debate.
A woeful thing to see:
A Princely life to misers state,
converted for to bee.
O Oedipus thy fatal fall,
thy dreadful mischiefs right.
Thy dolfull state, thy misery,
thy thrice unhappy plight:
These things shall blase through all ye world:
what hart may thē rejoice
At thy distress? I can no more:
my tears do stop my voice.
But what is he that yonder stamps?
and raging puffs and blows,
And often shakes his vexed head,
some mischief great he knows.
(What news good sir with you?)
WHen Oedipus accursed wretch,
his fatal false had spied,
(And mischiefs great.)
To Hell he damned his wretched soul
and on the Gods he cried
For vengeance due. And posting fast
with frantic mood &amp; grisly hue,
Unto his dolfull Court he went,
his thoughts for to pursue.
Much like a Lion ramping wyld,
his furious head that shakes.
And roors with thundering mouth aloud
And often gnashing makes,
None otherwise this miser fared.
A loathsome sight to see.
Besides himself for very rage,
he styll desires to die.
And rolling round his wretched eyes
with visage pale and wan:
Ten thousand Curses out he powers.
Himself the unhappiest man
Of all that live, he doth account:
As justly he may doe.
A wretch. A slave. A Caitiff vile.
The cause of all his woe.
And in this case inflamed with spite
he cries, he stamps, he raves.
And boiling in his secret thoughts
he styll desires to have.
All torments under Son that may
his Cares conceived increase.
O wretched wight, what should he do?
What man may him releas?
Thus foaming all for rage at mouth,
with sighs, and sobs, and groans,
His damned head ten thousand times.
as oft his wearied bones
He beats. And often puffing makes,
and roors, and swells, and sweats.
And on the Gods for death he calls,
for Death he styll entreats.
Three times he did begin to speak:
and thryse his tong did stay.
At length he cried out aloud:
O wretch Away, away.
Away thou monstrous Beast he said:
Wilt thou prolong thy lyf•?
Nay rather some man strike this breast
with stroke of bludy knife.
Or all you Gods aboue on me
your flaming fierce outcast:
And dints of Thunderbolts down •hrow
This is my Prayer last.
What greedy vile devouring G••pe,
upon my guts will gnaw?
What Tiger fierce my hateful limb•
will quite asundre draw?
Lo, here I am you Gods: Lo, here,
wreak now on me your will•
Now, now you fyry feends of Hell,
of vengeance take your fill.
Send out some wild outrageous beast
send Dogs me to devour.
Or else all yls you can deuyse,
at once upon me power.
O woeful soul. O sinful wretch.
Why dost thou fear to dye?
Death only rids frō woes you know.
Than stoutly Death defy.
With that his bluddy fatal Blade,
from out his sheath he draws,
And loud he cries. What now?
thou beast? Why dost thou paws?
Thy father you hast slain. Thou, thou.
Thou Cayteyf vile.
Thou wretch, you Slave, you Beast, you dost
thy Mothers Bed defile.
And Brothers you hast got. Nay Sons
Sons: Thou least: thy brothers all
They are. Thus for thy monstrou• lust
thy Country down doth fall.
And think thou than for al these yls
enough so short a payne?
Think you the Gods will be apeasde,
if thou forthwith be slain?
So many mischiefs don: And first
enough one stroke to bide?
Accownst •thou it sufficient payne,
that once thy Blade should glide
Quite thrugh thy guilty guts for all?
Why then dispatch and dye.
So moist thou recōpence thy Fa∣theirs
death sufficiently.
Let it be so. What mends unto
thy Mother will thou make•?
Unto thy children what? These plags
how will thou slake•?
That al for the• thy Cou•trey wastes?
One push shall end them all.
A propre fetch. A fine deuyse.
For thee a worthy fall
Invent thou Monstrous Beast.
A fall en worthy for
The self invent: whom al m•n hate
and loath, and do abhor.
And as Dame Natures lawful course
is brooke thou wretch by thee,
So let to such a mischief great,
thy Death agr•yng bee.
O that I might a thousand times,
my wretched life renew.
O that I might revive and dye
by Course in ordre dew.
Ten hundred thousand times &amp; more
Than should I vengeance take
Upon this wretched pate. Than I
perhaps in part should make
A meet amends outright, for this
my foul and loathsome Syn.
Than should ye proof of pain reprove
the life that I live in.
The choice is in thy hand you wretch,
than use thine own discretion.
And find a means, whereby you may
com to extreme confusion.
And that, yt oft thou may not doo
let it prolonged bee.
Thus, thus, moist you procure at length
an endless Death to thee.
Search out a death whereby you may
perpetual shame obtain:
And yet not dye. But styll to live
in everlasting payne.
Why stayst thou man? Go to I say:
What mean these blubbering tears
Why weepst thou thus? Alas to late.
Leave of thy foolish fears.
And first enough to weep think thou?
shall tears and wailing serve?
No wretch it shall not be. Thou dost
ten thousand deaths deserve.
Mine eyes do dally with me I see,
and tears do styll out power.
Shall gushing tears suffice? Not so,
I shall them better scour.
Out with thine eyes, he said: And than
with Fury fierce inflamed:
Like to a bludy raging Feend,
and Monstrous Beast vntamd.
With fiery flaming spotted cheeks
his breast he often beats.
And scratch, and tear his face he doth
and Skin asundre frets.
That scarce his eyes in head could stand
so sore he them besets.
With furious fierce outrageous mind
he stamps &amp; cries aloud:
And roors &amp; rayls, with ramping rage.
Thus in this case he stood,
Perplexed, and vexed sore in mind,
with deadly sighs and tears.
When suddenly all franticklyke
himself from ground he rears.
And roots out his wretched eyes.
And sight asundre tears.
Than gnasheth he his bludy teeth,
and bites, and gnaws, &amp; champs,
His ei•s all bathd and brewed in blood,
for fury fierce he stamps.
And raging more than needs alas,
his eyes quite rooted out:
The very holes in vayn he scrapes
so sore the wretch doth d•ut:
Least sight should chance for to re∣mayn
he rents &amp; mangls quite
His face, his eyes, his nose, his mouth
And all whereon his hands do light
He rigs &amp; ryues. Thus foully rayd
alas in piteous plight:
At length his head aloft he lifts,
and therewith gyves a shright.
And when he sees that all is gone,
both light, and sight, and all.
Than screeching owt: he thus begins
upon the Gods to call.
Now spare you Gods, spare now,
my Country pressed to fall.
I have done that you did cōmaund:
Your wraths revenged bee.
This wretched look, this mangled face,
is fittest now for thee.
Thus speaking down ye blakish blud
by streams doth gushing flow
Into his mouth. And clottred lumps
of flesh the place doth strew
(Wherein he stands.)
Beware betimes, by him beware,
I speak unto you all.
Learn Justice, truth, &amp; fear of Gods
By this unhappy fall.
OUr lyf with tōblyng fatal course
of Fortunes whele is told.
To it give place, for it doth run
al swiftly uncontrolled
And Cares &amp; tears are spent in vayn
for it can not be stayed:
But needs must run the rated race,
of Destinies all decreed.
What mākynd hydes or does on earth
it cōmmeth from aboue.
Then wailing groans poured out in griefs
do nought at all behove.
Our lyf must have her pointed course
Alas what shall I say.
As fates, decrees, so things do run.
no man can make them stay.
For at our birth to gods is known
our latter dying day.
No Prayer, no Art, not God himself
may fatal fates resist.
But fastened all in fixed course,
unchanged they persist.
Such end them styll ensues as they
appointed were to have,
Than fly all fear of Fortunes chaūge
seek not to live a slave
Enthrald in bondage vile to fear.
For fear doth often bring
Destnies that dreded ben and mis∣cheyfs
feared upon vs slyng.
Yea many a man hath com unto
his fatal end by fear.
Wherefore set peevish fear aside,
and worthy courage bear.
And thou that Subject art to Death.
Regard thy latter day.
Think no man blessed before his end
Advise the well and staye.
Be sure his life, and death, and all,
be quite exempt from misery:
Ere thou do once presume to say:
this man is blessed and happy.
But owt alas, see where he coms:
A wretch withouten Guide,
Bereft of sight. Half spoiled of life:
Without all pomp and Pride
(That unto kings Estate belongs.)
VUell, well: Its don. More yet?
No no no more remains
My Fathers rites performed are.
What God? on Misers pains
That rues. Within this Cloud hath told
&amp; wrapped my wretched pate.
Ah sir: this is a life alone.
This is a happy state.
This is a case en fit for thee,
for thee thou wretch, for thee.
From whose accursed sight the Son,
the Stars and all do flee.
Yet mischiefs more who gyves to do?
The dreadful day I have
Escaped. Thou filthy Parricide:
Thou vile mischievous Sla••.
Unto thy right hād nought thou oust
all things performed bee.
Unhappy man that ever I lived
this wretched day to see.
Where am I now alas:
The light and all doth vs
Abhor. This look is first for the,
th•u miserable Oedipus.
Se se, where Iocasta coms,
with fierce and furious mood,
Quite past her self. For very rage
she frets and waxes wood.
Like to sir Cadmus Mother mad,
who late her Son did kill:
Fain wold she speak her mind: For fear
alas she dares not: Styll
She stays. And yet all shamefastness
these yls have quite exiled
(From out her wretched breast.)
Fain wold I speak, I am afraid
for what should I the call
My Son? dowt not. Thou art my Son
My Son thou art for all
These mischiefs great. Alas, alas,
my Son is ashamed of me.
O cruel Son. Where dost thou turn
thy face? Why dost thou flee
From me? From me thy Mother dear
Why dost thou shun my sight?
And leave me thus in misery
with Cares consumed quite.
Who troubles me? Let me alone.
I thought not to be fownd:
Who now restores mine eyes to me
my Mother, or my Mothers sound?
Our labour all is spent in vain,
now may we meet no more.
The Seas divide those meetings vile
that we have had before.
The gaping year•h divide vs both,
the one from tother quite.
Styll let our feet repugnant bee.
So shall I shun the light
(That most of all me greues.)
The Destinies are in faut. Blame thē.
Alas, alas, not wee.
Spare now. Leave of to speak in vain
Spare now O Mother me,
By these Relics of my dismem∣bred
body I thee pray.
By mine unhappy Children pled∣ges
left. What shall I say?
By all the Gods I thee beseech,
By all that in my name,
(Is either good or bad)
Let me alone. To trouble me,
Alas you are to blame.
O woofull Soul O wretched hart
Why dost thou faint alas?
Why doest thou seek and toil in vain
these ills to overpass.
What mean these sighs and boiling tears?
Why dost you pains refuse?
Thou mate of all his mischiefs thou,
by whose means only rues
The law of nature all: by whom
Ah, Ah, counfonnded lies,
Both god and man and be and all
that either lives or dies.
Die you. dispatch at once. thrust through
thy vile incestruous breast.
Not thou if god him self, if he
his flaming fierce should throw
On thee, or mischiefs all by heaps
upon thy body strew
Could once repay dew pains
for thy deserved yls.
(Thou filthy wretch: Thou wicked Mother thou.)
Death death now best cōtenteth me
than seek a way to dye.
So may thou yet at length find end
for this thy misery.
O Son lend me thy hand, if that
thou art a Parricide?
This labour last of all remains:
this labour thee doth bide.
Dispatch rid me thy Mother dear
from all my wretched woe.
It will not be. No prayers move.
Thy self this deed must doe.
Take up this sword. Go to. With this
thy husband once was slain.
Thy Husband? Thou termst him false.
Thy father he was. O deadly pain.
Shall I quite through my breast
or through my throat it thrust?
Can you not choose thy wound? Away
dye dye, alas thou must.
This breast. This womb. Than woūd
this, this, with thine own hand.
Strike, pierce, and spare it not:
which both a Husband: and
(The same a Son did bear.
Alas alas, she is slain, she is slain,
dispatched with a push:
Who ever saw the like to this:
Se how the blud doth gush
From out her wounded breast.
(O heavy dolfull Case.)
Thou God. Thou teller out of fates.
On thee, on thee, I call,
My Father only I did owe,
unto the Destinies all.
Now twice a Parricide and more
than I did fear mischievous
My Mother I have slain. Alas
I am the cause. Its thus.
O Oedipus accursed wretch,
lament thine own Calamity,
Lament thy state, thy grief lament,
thou Caitiff borne to misery.
Where will thou become alas?
Thy face where will thou hyde:
O miserable Slave, can thou
such shameful torments bide?
Can you which hast thy Parents slain
Can thou prolong thy life?
Wilt thou not dye? deserving Death
Thou cause of all the grief
And Plages, &amp; dreadful mischiefs all
that Th•bane City preas.
Why dost thou seek by longer life.
thy sorrows to increase?
Why dost thou toil and labour thus
in vain? It will not bee.
Both God a•d man: and beast, and all
abhor thy face to see.
O E•rth why gapst thou not for me?
Why do you not unfold
Your selfs you gates of Hell me to re∣•eyue?
Why do you hence wthold
The fierce infernal Feends frō me,
from me so wretched wight?
Why break not all the Furies lose?
this hateful head to smyght
With Plages: which them deserved hath
Alas I am left alone
Both light, and sight, and comfort all
from me (O wretch) is gone.
O cursed head: O wicked wight,
whom al• men deadly hate.
O Beast what meanst you styll to live
in this unhappy state.
The Skies do blush and are ashamed,
at these thy mischiefs great:
The earth laments, the heauēs weep
the Seas for rage do freat.
And blustering rise, &amp; storms do stir,
and all thou wretch for the:
By whose incestuous loathsome lust
all things disturbed be.
Quite out of course displaced quite
O cursed fatal day.
O mischiefs great. O dreadful times
O wretch, away away.
Exile thy self from all men's sight
thy life half spent in misery.
Go end: consume it now outright:
in thri•e as great Calamity.
O lying Phebe I have done more
than my Destnie was to do.
With trēblyng fearful pa•e go forth•
thou wretch• Monster go.
Grope out thy ways on knees in dark
thou miserable slave.
So moist thou yet in tract of time,
due pains and vengeance have
For thy mischievous life: Thus thus,
the Gods themselves decree:
Thus thus thy fates: thus thus ye skies
appoint it for to bee.
Than headlong hence: with a mischief hence
O Caitiff vile away:
Away, away, thou monstrous Beast
Go. Ron. Stand. Stay.
Lest on thy Mother thou do fall.)
All you that wearied bodies have,
with syckenes overpressed:
Lo now I fly: I fly away.
The cause of your unrest,
(I fly.)
Lift up your heads: A better state
of Air shall straight ensewe,
When I am gone for whom alone
these dreadful mischiefs grew.
And you that now, half dead yet live
in wretched misers case,
Help those whō present tormēts pres
forth, hye you on apace.
For lo, with me I carry hence
all mischiefs under Skies.
All cruel fates, Diseases all
that for my sake did rise,
With me they go: with me, both grief
Plage, Pocks, Botch, and all
The yls that either now you pres
or ever after shall.
With me they go. With me, with me.
These Mates ben meetst of all
(For me.)
