YOur fears are vain Arontas.
I wish to heavens they would
not prove
True Omens to the King∣dome.
Can you suppose the King, whose pow∣earful
nod
Can force a thousand Virgins, to become
their own bawds,
And prostitue themselves unto his loose em∣braces,
Will for one coy girl resign that g•ft
Only in which the Gods can truly boast
their liberty?
Fie Arontas, think not so poorly of your
Sovereign;
He is a Man, and therefore has Ambition.
So has he Love.
But can that Love,
That weaker fancy of an idle brain,
Make Charastus yield, unto a composition,
so absurd?
As for to grant a Kingdom for a conquest.
It is to be feared; The obdurate
Girl
Persists still in her enterprise: nor will she
yee'd
The fortress of her Love without the resig∣nation
Of his Diadem unto her Brother, a man
Ambitious as the Devil.
Hear reason.
It is not her will alone,
The women's chiefest argument, that denies
him,
But her weighty reasons, with which she still
convinces
All that dare venture opposition.
Is not the Kings prerogative an are∣gument
Beyond weak women's will? The wise men
say,
Kings ought to force when subjects wo'nt o∣bay.
Love cannot sir be for•'d;
It is a spirit thinner than Air, which when
With boisterous hands we strive to capti∣vate
Doth vanish into nothing.
But should the King, in this his
height of dotage,
Offer up his crown, the Trophy of her
cruelty,
Think you his Subjects will ever give consent
That one should wear it, so generally hated
as Bermudo?
One filled with such variety of wickedness,
•s if the end of his creation was
Only to shame his Maker.
Did he deserve a Worser character,
Yet when the Crown, when that imperi∣all
Gem
Once triumphs on his brow, his Vices Sir
Will turn to virtues: such is the fate of
Princes.
Nor may we sir oppose his reign
Since tic our King that wills it.
Kings are the Gods immediate Substitutes,
And their VVills are most divine, and holy
statutes,
Which our Religion in so strict a manner
Binds us to observe, that should Bermudo,
In that very instant, on which the Crown
Is placed upon his head, command our lives,
It were more impiety to contradict,
Than cruelty to obey.
Strange superstition!
It may seem so to you, a stranger:
for
Foreign Nations laugh at us, and call our
zeal
A blind obedience, their prouder hearts
Can brooke no Kings, but like unruly steeds
Contemn their Riders, and blow Rebellion,
Witchcrafts Ape,
Even in the faces of their Sovereigns; good
Gods!
Is this piety? is this Religion? shall He
The principal of all subordinates, one by
that Royal wreath
Distinguished from the common Chaos, and
created Head?
Shall He be subject to the VVills of an
Irregular Multitude that Knows nothing
of a States necessity?
The Sun•and slave that labours at the Oar
Knows not a life so servile then. But let um
on,
And glory in their disobedience: we whose
souls
Has still been subject to those higher powers,
Must always think that man is chiefly blessed,
That suffers.
Be Happy then, I dare pronounce you
Happy
If Bermudo reigns; Felicity with a avenge∣ance
Will flow unto you, till its hideous tor∣rent
Has consumed the Kingdom.
If it is our fate 't•s welcome, twill
only prove
The greater Argument of our Allegiance.
The Citadel, of which I am the unworthy
Master
Must be kept strongly for him, till his Will,
Not Tyranny disclaims it.
No more: The Kings on entrance.
Was it not a direful Tempest that last
night
Affrighted our Horizon? was ever yet your age
Acquainted with the like Halisdus?
Never my gracious Lord: yet I have
seen
Many, that would have terrified the boldest:
When our Aetnean Hill, spitted his fiery
venom
Against the Heavens; when the affrighted
Sun
For three days has withdrawn himself;
yet these
Compared with this for horror,
Deserve not to be mentioned.
It was a dreadful night indeed; yet
see
How gloriously the Sun appears: the
Heavens
In labour were all night, &amp; from their prig∣nant
womb
This morn a Sun springs forth, whose glo∣rios
beams
Frights back their pristine terror.
Were it not a sin too great and ir∣religious
To mistrust the heavens diviner Mercy,
I should conceive this ill-aboding night
Portended some ensuing misery.
Doe not Halisdus with thy miscon∣struing
fear
Strive to disturb our joys: Thy sight Fla∣vent,
Like to Auroras Beams, darted from out the
Eastern Hills,
Expels those drossy exhalations, which this
too sad night
Infused to my sadder soul.
Your highness has a privilege for
flattery.
Still harping on that string Flavan∣da?
If for to speak what my inclining soul
Prompts me to utter, and to conceive what
I have said
Is but a derogation from thy worth, be Flat∣tery,
I must confess I am guilty of that fault,
Which never King did act, unless upon
himself.
Pardon my incredulity great Sir.
When I consider that the lofty Pines
Stoop not to brambles, that your S•aring
Hawks
Bend not to lesser Birds, except for prey:
I must confess
My virgin fear holds back those wandering
thoughts
Which your Al-potent Majesty extracted
Lest I should perish like a hasty Blossom
Cropped by the setting winter.
Is yet my Loyalty in question?
How oft have I with sacrilegious lips
Dissected all the Gods for Oaths, and must I
still
Remain suspected of disloyalty? surely I
have a conscience.
Yes, pure and more spotless than
the wandering snow
Which the least breath of any calmer wind
Blows up and down: such a conscience,
That had it not a burden of Felicity
I should court its Master.
Was ever yet Felicity a Burden?
Yes, that which you vainly stile one:
You doe suppose a Crown a brave and glo∣rios
Trophy of felicity, which had you been
without,
One poor commanding word had done
that deed,
Which now your vain entreaties sue for.
You are my King Sir.
But tell me Dearest, how has my for∣mer
life
Deserved that title of your King: has my taxa∣tions
Ever yet filled my oreflowing coffers?
Have I replenished once my appetite
With the direful noise of any subjects cur∣ses?
Our gentler reign abhorred those vices
Which most Kings doe Boast in: And can
thou think
When I doe subjugate my self to thee,
I shall become more ravenous than when
I was
Sole Monarch?
I dare not question Sir that virtue
which in you
All Princes can't admire enough, much
more not imitate.
Tic not the Tyrannic usage of a Sceptre
That confirm's a King; He that is truly
Royal,
Rules not his kingdom with the severe
And cruel Rigour of an austerer judgement,
But with a mild severity, a virtue which
you
Have practised long; I must confess, you
are adorned
With all the Ornaments that make a
King
A second Deity; But can those glorious
trappings,
Your Crown, your sceptre, armed with that
virtue too,
Can they all resist those blasts, which en∣vious
fame
Will hurl upon my honour?
What can the giddy multitude
report
Against thy virtues? Thou art beyond
their malice.
I were beyond then all that's
good,
Beyond the heavens themselves, and the
celestial powers.
That Love that tends to a superior,
Be it ne'er so pure, is amongst them
But an ambitious Lust, sold for preferment.
Should Hymen join our hands in a lawful
union
With our hearts, yet they would say,
Flavanda does not give, but prostitutes her
love
To satisfy her vain Ambition: Thus I
should ever
Rather bee thought your Strumpet, than
your Wife.
Can thou suspect me yet Flavan∣da?
I should suspect my self rather, for
I know
Our sex are all like watery clouds
Made various still by the reflecting Sun.
Whilst that the Crown, Great Sir,
Impels your Royal Brow, I cannot be your
Wife
And to be your Whore, I dare not.
Unfortunate condition of a King!
when that
Hi• chiefest Ornament becomes his greatest
punishment.
A Crown, and Sceptre are but transitory
toys,
That wait on big and pompous Misery.
Oh thou ambitious Man, whose soaring
thoughts
Aim only at a crown! knew thou
The inconver•ence now of mine, thou
then
Would wish, thou had rested in secu∣rity,
And ne'er had sought so vain a happiness,
If that your boasted constancy bee
firm
As it were a sin to suspect the contrary,
That our loves may not diminish from each
others lustre,
Invest my Brother in your dignity: So I a
Princess
May equal you a some•times King.
Must I resign, or perish in felicity?
Is this thy doom then still irrevocable?
As Fate.
A sad and dismal sentence! yet stay,
And ere I part with this same glorious
gem,
Let me recall the long lost man within me,
And with him, Mans better part, my
Reason,
Reason! alas I have none
This trifle woman has unmand my soul,
And made me like her self irrational.
Reason would tell me that I am a King,
And in that name, something there is
That whispers to my thoughts I may com∣mand.
It is true, I may, o'er things
Gross as my self; This arm of mine can level
Cedars with the humblest shrubs, and this
my voice
Can with one accent, breath more certain
Fate
Than plague, or Fire. But can its loudest
note
Silence one murmuring thought? or can this
potent grasp
Enclose heavens lighting, or the smallest
beam
Which from the sun is darted? Love is
more pure
And less substantial, it is no created body,
Form,
And Matter, but an ethereal essence, Fan∣cease
creatures.
And to be Master of an immaterial Soul,
Who would refuse to sacrifice that dross,
That clogs Mortality? He is a beast
That would not fall, to rise a Constellation.
Yet, Sir, consider what you give,
A Crown, a Sceptre, and a Kingdom.
These are but titular Emblems of
•elicity,
Visions of Bliss, Symptoms of Happiness.
What is there in a crown, worthy our esti∣motion?
Place it here in its most proper spha•re,
It is but a glorious trifle; look now Ha∣lisdus
With impartial eyes, and tell me which
casts
The greater lustre; thy silence does con∣damn
thee.
See, I kiss it, embrace it, and no virtuous
heat
Pays a gratuity: One Kiss of hers
Makes me contemplate of a future happi∣ness
That rapes me to an Ecstasy of pleasure.
Dull, senseless, and base stupid E•rth,
Go to the Center; My aerie thoughts
climbs Heaven,
And grasped now a Deity.
Beware a cloud Ixion▪ if my plo••s
hit right,
It shall be twice as fatal.
Yet here Bermudo
I doe fully cease, here that my soul
Be quite dismantled of that glorious robe
Which Fate so freely did allot 〈◊〉,
Oh let these dewy drops, the truest
Harbingers
of a set•ing Sun, entreat thee
Not to bring my frailty to a custom:
Do not, oh do not! do•te like me Bermudo,
Let not posterity in succeeding times
Account this folly lawful, and traduce Me,
Me the Original; Twill vex me in my
urn.
It shall not sir. I'll break the custom,
And to show how much my solo's
Obedient to your will, and that the world
may see
That it is not pomp nor majesty affects me,
I make a vow before just heavens, and you,
That if ere my heart be conquered with a
women's love,
Your Crown shall be restored.
Thou know not what thou vow'st
Bermudo.
I doe my Lord, and know withal
How strictly Religion binds me to perfor∣mance;
For should I dare to violate what I have
vowed,
It would call a curse upon me, high
As the punishment Damnation pays to sin∣ners:
I must then royal sir, &amp; so must ye, my Lords,
And Peers of Lelybaeus, acknowledge him
again
Your Sovereign, unless a doe a deed
Which humane frailty names impossible,
Can thou be so good Bermudo?
It is not a Crown great sir,
With that same large Prerogative annexed,
Can make Bermudo be ungrateful;
You nourished my declining fortunes,
And brought them to that height which
now
They stand in, and should I like ungatefull
plant
Consume the stem that nourished me,
In•amy would surely blast me.
Thus then I doe indulge thee
All the prerogatives of Majesty.
Go and ascend my throne, and let all with
one applause
Say after me, Long live Bermudo King of
Lelybaeus.
Long live Bermudo King of Lily∣beaus.
Long live Bermudo King of Lily∣beaus.
Long live Bermudo King of Lily∣beaus.
I have it now, seated firm, beyond
the power
Of Revocation: Thanks to the Heavens,
And our diviner Policy. Long has this King∣dome
Under the easy yoke of an esteminate
King
Surfeited with luxury, and been a Proverb
For our neighbouring Princes to express
lasciviousness:
The thought whereof did grate my heart,
And stirred a noble Anger in my blood.
Shame of all Kings, dishonour of thy race,
It was I that forced my credulous •ester
To make this trial of thy constancy.
I made Flavanda to demand thy Crown,
only
With a promise to restore it: But can you
think
A Gem so lost, will ever be found
Before the extirpation of that seed
Which thy effeminate government has sown
In this too much abused Kingdom?
If that the thought of what I was
Can not procure some reverence,
Yet slight me not •or what I may be,
When the conditions which you hold
Your Kingdom by are broken.
Condition•s? It is true, I promised
when ever
My heart was conquered with a women's love
Your Crown should be restored.
That was not all▪ A vow
Was past to me, sealed with an Oath,
That when our Nuptials should be solemn∣niz'd
You would restore the Kingdom.
It is confessed: nor dare I disobey it.
Vows of this nature may not be broken
Without the violation of Religion.
Come dearest then, let Hymenae all
Rites
Restore a double happiness.
Stay rash man, hear our Decree first▪
Read Arontas, and let thy voiyce
Strike terror to the Nation.
Whereas this •ertile Kingdom, under
the easy reign of our esteminate predecease∣sor,
has long su•setred with a degenerate
passion, which the weaker ones stile Love,
the wiser Folly, to the high dishonour of the
Nation, and great displeasure of that Virgin
Goddess whose rites we ought to celebrate.
That we may now therefore repair our lost
honour, appease the wrath of that incens∣ed
Deity, and avert those judgments which
are now so imminent; We have thought
fit to decree, and be it decreed by the most
high, and excellent Bermudo, the Supreme
Lord, and Ruler of this Nation, that for
the space of seven years next ensuing, none
shall presume to entertain that passion: If
any one shall presumpt•ously, contrary to
this our pleasure, be •and so weak as to
express it in the least of Circumstance, their
lives to Heavens shall forfeit,
You have heard our will Charastus,
Presume not then to disobey it: It is not
the remembrance
Of your former greatness, or the Peoples
love,
Can exempt you from the justice of our an∣ger.
Coldest thou suppose, fond man, Bermudo
Would restore a Crown for bare gratuity;
No,
I did but pull away the bait, to make
The hasty fish receive it with more eager∣nos,
Which now is caught, thanks to our In∣dustry:
And that the captive may not flatter his
imagination
With a hopes of a Recovery, Let our De∣crees
be published.
That sir you have a power to punish
my credulity,
This knee, ne'er bent before to humane
greatness, testifies.
Oh Royal sir! Let the severity of your
Law stop here,
Here on my head let your anger fall:
Punish not my folly in your loyal Subjects,
Guilty in nothing but obedience. If not for
my sake,
For my sisters sake, for Desdonellas sake,
She though a Princess loved you sir a Sub∣jest:
I saw it, and was silent, and surely,
Had not I thought, you had supposed
I•gratitude the worst of evils,
I near had left my self so bare,
Clothed only with my shame and ruin.
If Desdonella harbours such a thought,
She feeds the flame that will consume her:
Nor she, nor any sir shall dare to doe,
What is denied their Sovereign.
Then thus proud man I rise,
And boldly tell you, that though Religion
Ties our hands, yet there's a power above
you,
Which neither custom nor Religion can
control,
He sir will punish to the height the deadly
sin
Of an abused Authority: Remember it, and
tremble.
Alas, fond maid, to what a deluge
of misfortune
Has this thy incredulity now brought thee?
What indigested heaps of misery has it
thrown
On thy ore-charged soul? Ye sacred
Powers
That guard distressed Innocence!
If that my brothers tyranny has not as yet
Exiled ye this Nation, pity my tears,
And since I needs must hate where I am
forced to love
Learn me a loving hate: But can I hope
The heavens will pity me in such a vale of
wickedness?
No surely, I'll therefore to the woods,
There harmless Innocence wrapped in secu∣ri•y,
Entombs faint envy, there vain Ambition
Covets no other Crown but Roses, No Scep∣la
But a Sheephook, these will I covet too.
Farewell Bermudo; and because once thou
were my brother,
In Heavens I wish thee.
And I thee in hell for wishing it.
Since that the Constellations yet do
want
A fierce and cruel Tiger, I'll pray the
Heavens
To place thee there, that when a Tyrant's
born,
The world may say Bermudo gave the in∣fluency.
My ill-spent tears bids thee adieu: Fare∣well
all cruelty,
A VVolfe and Lamb compared to us, for
symp•thy,
May well be styled the Zodiacs Gemini.
Farewell thou perfect Model of all
goodness,
Haste to the shady woods, there I will live,
In contemplation of thy excellence:
Loves Theory shall be my study; a Science
Far beyond thy reach Bermudo; thy grosser
•ence
Is ignorant of all loves, except of that
Whose baser flame knows no commerce
with purity,
That which insatiate lust perhaps has
prompt thee too;
Mine is a love superplatonick, a flame,
Whose bright continued Pyramid of splen∣dour
Shall soar above thy dull• reach Bermudo,
And make thy faint ambition become more
blind
Than are thy thoughts that guide it.
What curses mutterst to thy self?
Are they against me, or against the destinies?
Thou art not worthy of my curses,
And to curse my stars were irreligious,
For it was Love, not Fate
That made Charastus thus unfortunate.
Farewell, a pair of Fondlins.
Is Arontas gon to publish our Decree?
He is my Lord. Shall I recall him?
Stir not a foot to h•nder our designs.
Oh good my Lord! This is not
the way
To keep you in your Kingdom long Sir.
Why? Lives there a man so bold
As to violate the Majesty of a King?
It is a crime I must confess, that we
Scicilians
Most abhor; nor do I think there lives a man
So irreligious: But by your leave,
He is no King that has no Subjects,
And if you take this course, what Subjects
will remain?
Consider sir, Love is the principal cause
That begets you Subjects, And if you take
away
The Cause, the effect will follow.
Let not that trouble you sir.
Let it be your care joined with Arontas
To send a Guard unto the utmost limits of
our Kingdom
That bound upon the other Promontories
With a Commission to let none pass:
If any of another Nation come within their
reach,
Bring straight to our subjection; which don
Haste ye unto our Ports, burn there our ships;
If that a man escapes, your heads shall pay
his ransom.
We long have surfeited with extremes, and
now
Extremes shall cure this deadly malady,
Which Justice is Halisdus, and not Tie∣ronnie.
Once more in spite of fortune, and
the raging waves
Of a tumultuous Sea, does my unhappy foot
Salute the Earth again. Did ever man
From all eternity behold a night so dismal
Leave behind no sad remembrance of its
former horror?
Here's not a stem that's widowed of his
leaf,
No, nor one branch become
The hopeless issue of the Husbandman, but
all
In a sweet tranquillity enjoy that happiness
Which Nature has allotted them: I am
The only object of Heavens Tyranny,
Else had these senseless Plants
Perished this fatal night, when both the Are∣tick,
And Antarctic Poles, striving to kiss each o∣there,
Confounded Heaven, Earth, Sea, Hell, and All
Into an indigested Chaos: yet in this dire
Confusion of the Elements, these stand un∣touched
Outbraving Fortunes Malice, whilst wretch∣ed
I,
The heavens least part of care,
Was banded too and fro by the immerse∣less
winds
Uncertain of a rest, and had not the thought
Of thee my Thesbia, balanced my rottering
soul,
The insatiate bosom of the Ocean
Had been my wished•for grave.
Sir, the fortune of the Sea having cast me,
A sad and desolate man, upon the Confines
Of an unknown Land, I must desire
Your charitable disposition to declare
Your Countries name unto me.
Most willingly. Know sir you are
cast
Upon a most unfortunate shore, Lelybaeus
Is the Countries Name, one of the three
Promontorian Kingdoms of famous Scicily.
Heavens, now I see ye are not altoge∣there
cruel:
This is the happy Country that my voyage
aimed at.
Call it not happy sir, for tic the most
Infortunat'st habitation that ever man en∣joyed.
It seems not so by the outward Ap∣pearance.
Oh no! Nature has bedecked it with
the best
Of all her ornaments, nor could she, if she
would
Create another world, frame any part
To parallel with this.
What disastrous chance then
Has made it thus unfortunate?
Pardon me if I refuse to tell you that,
The relation whereof would draw tears
From my ore-charged eyes. Let this Decree
Inform you sir.
Heavens I thank ye: This courtesy
Will make me dye ungrateful to your
bounty.
Oh how my soul now gluts it self, to see his
enemy
Thus offered as a sacrifice to his incensed Ire!
Just anger seize me then, and Constantine,
Let the thoughts of thy sad sufferings
Inspire my soul with vengeance, arm my
strength
With a Revenge as ample as the cause:
Yet Prince Virtusus I'll not kill thee basely;
That were to mistrust my cause, which is as
just
As heavens are innocent, Thou shalt not dye
For to be damned in ignorance: No, I'll sum∣mon
All thy faults, and thunder '•m to thy ears;
If then thy treachery has not exiled thy va∣lore,
Let thy sword plead thy innocence:
By which most noble pleading thou shalt dye
Honoured, by my Revenges charity.
Oh my unjuster stars! Why did ye
stop
The Oceans mouth, denying me an entrance,
Yet bring me here to be entombed
Alive upon the shore? was it because I feared
Your threatening waves, or that the louder
winds
Struck terror to my affrighted Conscience?
This cannot be:
For how oft in scorn has my undaunted sighs
Echoed the blustering winds, and my full
tide eyes
For fear of scarcity, how oft have they
Replenished the waves, and nourished
The decaying Billows? Yet must all this be
The Prologue only to my ensuing Tragedy?
Oh cruel Pity! Oh inhumane charity!
Peace sir: The King.
Why kneel ye unto me sirs?
If I have not deserved your pity,
I have not deserved your scorn I am sure.
The Heavens forbid, when ere I see
Such Beams of Majesty, that I should pre∣sum
To approach without that awful adoration
Which my Allegiance pays unto my Sove∣reign.
It is true, good Subjects ought to
do so:
But when a Lion's dead, the baser Ass
Will come, and trample on him,
And spurn that face, which when alive
Was death to look on.
Such incivility becomes the Beasts;
But man whose purer soul
Claims something of divinity, can easily di∣scorn
That sacred Majesty which on Kings
Hang like the Gods re•in'd Idaeas: He cannot
be
So foolishly impious, to think the Sun,
Because oft-times he does obscure himself
Under the gloomy shade of some gross ex∣halation,
That he never will again come to his p•istine
splendour.
How oft do we see those blazing Members
Of the Ayre, decline? those fiery Comets,
Which though composed of exhalations
Covet the highest Region, where hurried
With their vain imaginations for a while
they reign,
Contracting their own ruin that at length
will come
As suddenly as fearful? Such will Bermudo's
fall be,
And the higher he lifts his towering thought•
The deadlier will his precipice become.
Can thou perceive that Majesty
which to Kings
Is still essential, and speak these words a∣against
Thy lawful Sovereign? Surely thou art no
Scicilian.
I am great sir, and yet dare say
It is virtue makes a King: Majesty without
that
Is a disjointed structure that must fall,
And come to ruin. It is not a Crown alone
That I adore, for should I do•e on that,
And slight the goodness which you are
Master of,
I were worse than he, that fears the Idol,
Yet contemns the Godhood: since then
Bermudo
Wants the better part of King, a Royal
soul,
I'll look on him, as on polluted incense,
Sacred, though not holy; And on you, as on
An unfurnished Temple, pious, though not
glorious.
Then pardon sir, if I prefer an indecent
sanctity
Before a comely wickedness.
Could thou distinguish, I confess
it were just:
But since wise Nature has ordained
Goodness essential to Supremacy, it is fit
You serve and honour him.
And so I will: but it must be
As Infidels do Devils, for fear, not love.
Far be it from me sir to confine
Goodness to Greatness only, or suppose that
man
Is solely Rovall that's ambitious;
That were to think the Heavens an easy
sponge,
From which the daring soul
Squeezes his ends out: He rather sir is great
That dares be good.
Then thou art great I swear; ex∣ceeding
great:
Thou can distinguish between good and
good.
Had I had such an intellectual soul
To put a difference twixt those attributes
That make a King complete, the gilded
flashes of his tongue
Would then have rendered him, as far con∣temptible,
As now he is fatal. Come nearer to us
Shepherd:
Nay! flatter not a falling greatness;
To kneel unto an Altar that's defaced
Smells more of Superstition than Devotion▪
Arise, worthy our Arms,
And if thou needs will serve thy King
In me his small Epitome, chide not his folly
With this strict observance; to make him
Master
Of those joys, which •e han'• power to com∣mand,
Is exprobation not affection.
Noble Charastus!
Thy miseries cannot outvie thy virtues,
Nor can they suffer an ignoble act
To derogate from fortunes Conquest,
Though she has made thy sufferings
Ample as her power. Wonder not, great
Prince,
Who it is dares Comment on thy miseries,
Since none can truly know a Kingdoms
loss,
But he that feels it.
If thou hast lost one then,
And that experience stimulates this bold∣nos,
I shall rejoice in thy society: I oft have seen
A feathered Captive sadly in a cage
Mourning in silence his determined free∣dome,
But having got a partner of his sufferings, the
silly Bird,
As if revived by another mischief,
Has from his drowsy taciturnity awaked,
Chirping sweet Io Paeans to our ravished ears,
Until his eyes became the sad oblation
Of his fainting voice.
Behold a partner then, O•e
That fortunes malice has in sundry shap••
Horrid as Cowards fears, or midnight ap∣prehensions,
Strove to appal his courage, yet to him
Those P•nick horror• seemed but painted
fires
Quenched with the smallest drop of's resolve∣tion.
Behold a Prince equally distressed:
But if our sympathetic•ll disasters
Has not created an instinct to know me,
Sum up your patience sir, •nd that will
tell you
That none can parallel its fortitude,
Except Pachynas Prince, Unfortunate Fire∣tusut.
Stay, and ere thou further speak
Let me survey thee sully, for in thee is drawn
The just resemblance of my misery.
By all our former happiness! It is rarely
limm'd;
Fortune, thou had eyes, thou ne'er could
Copy me so truly else.
Oh Royal Prince, my woes sad character!
Let us incorporate, and be one,
One Monumental Trophy of misfortune.
Bear witness oh thou sacred Register of un∣ted
hearts,
How Virtusus here joys to behold Chara∣stus
there.
Allied thus by misfortune, our un∣ted
wills
Shall hate a separation. One act we'll still
pursue;
One thought we'll think; One soul we'll
have;
One heart, and one Ambition.
Ambition! In that we'll imitate our
mother Earth,
To fall is her Ambition, should she aspire,
It were not Ambition, because not natural.
This Union sown in tears
Shall rise in glory; my prophetic soul di∣vines
it:
Mean while we'll live here in these woods
disguised,
Sometimes we'll visit Court, and see if Fate
Will put a period to our sufferings, till then
From you renowned Shepherd we must
crave concealment.
Your graces may command your
humblest vassal.
I have a story of my own to tell you; But
for a while
I must crave leave to lie concealed.
Then we'll not urge it.
Hence, hence Ambition now, and all those
pleasing thoughts,
Which Crowns and Scepters whistled to our
ears.
The silent Groves, and murmuring streams,
The shady woods, and whistling winds,
will be
A recreation beyond Court vanities. There
we three
Will fancy to our selves a Triarchy.
Of what aerie substance is Mans soul
That still it is so ambitious to aspire?
The higher still I am lifted, the more I covet.
Is there no end Heavens of our vain desires?
Cannot a Crown and Sceptre stay our towr∣ing
thoughts?
But must we aim at things impossible?
Are we All composed of that same dispute∣ble
element
Whose questioned flames outstrips the
highest Region?
Is there no Earth comixed within us,
Or did we drop it at our first creation?
Thou envious Man, why come thou with a
face
So wretched, thus to check our joys?
What sorrow 'ist thy tears does thus prog∣nosticate?
I now lament the woeful fruits
Of your dire cruelty: Oh too much wrong∣ed
Princess!
Wretched Desdonella!
What of her? Perhaps her passion
Has cause her to lay violent hands upon her
self.
Is it not so?
Your Highness is too true a Prophet,
For the woeful Princess when as the fatal
news
Of her dear brothers Misery, resounding in
her ears
Was seconded by the late published edict,
Knowing
That she could not live without your anger,
Which to her was worst of miseries,
Threw her dejected body into the hideous
stream,
Where the en••oured wa•es proud of their
rich prey
Even kilt he• with embracings▪
She was a fond and foolish woman.
We will not spend one tear would it recover
her.
She loved you sir to• too well.
For that we will not▪ Those looser
thoughts
Shall never ceise Bermudo▪ The world shall
know,
To offend in those absurdities is not the Na∣ture
But the Vice of Power, from which I'll fly
As from a singing Siren, or a weeping Cro∣cadile.
What news portends your haste?
Two ships my gracious Lord, this
morn
Arrived within your harbour, which we,
Bound by our duty, &amp; your express Command,
Took, ransaked, and burnt: But seizing of
the men,
Two cried out, Lay not your hands on sacred
Majesty;
For we are Kings: yet nevertheless
We have brought um here to be examined
by your highness.
Spies on my life! Let um be brought
before us;
They shall dye. Tic I, their fate, have said it.
Kings are not safe in their own territories;
But still are subject unto Treachery.
He that ascends a Throne by such severe,
And unjust dealing, goes but on a slippery
path,
Where but to a stumble is a precipice.
Beware Bermudo then, Traps are laid to take
thee,
Envie's big, and will be delivered of her brat
Ambition,
Which we must strangle in the Infancy,
Or all will perish.
He that begins in mischief must go on, and
in it reign,
If he but leanes to virtue once, he false amain.
OH save thee Great Prince, from yo•∣der
Hill
A fierce and cruel Beast comes raging.
Where is this hideous Monster?
Alas! it follows thee▪ Here, take this
sword,
And stand upon thy Guard: See, how •e
yawns,
As if he meant to swallow thee alive:
His eyes are numberless from which pro∣ceeds
Such a sulphurous flame, that alas, I fear,
The very smell will kill thee: Oh what a
black
And noisome mist his gaping mouth sends
forth?
His tongues spit floods of venom, and his
reaching tail
Sweeps down whole mountains, on his
Crested back doth rise, so many and such
massy spears,
That you would swear whole Armies
Came to thy destruction.
I see nothing, sir, so horrid.
Alas, it comes invisible.
Would have me fight with sha∣dowes?
I fear you are distracted sir.
So, now you are safe from company,
I'll be more plain.
This fierce inhumane Beast, which I so men∣tion'd,
Lodges here, here in my Breast his den is,
Long on my inmost Bowels he has gnawed
Lacking his worthy prey; But now on thee
He means to seize. Revenge his Name is;
You may guess the Monster.
My innocence is ignorant of his Na∣ture.
I'll prompt it in few words. You
must dye.
It is acknowledged: So must we All.
Nay, by this Hand I mean, Reven∣ges
Instrument.
I am so innocent,
I can't persuade my self to credit you.
Cowards still plead Innocence.
Dare thou not fight?
My cause too good is, yours too bad.
Think what a stain my honour would re∣ceive,
Should I but fight when such an inequality
Parts our causes.
Oh Coward!
Are you more valiant, Because
In a distempered rage you dare draw a
sword,
Which not provoked you durst not?
It is he is truly valiant that will fight,
Not when his furious Blood boils
In his veins thus, not when a fervent inun∣dation
Swells his distempered channels, but when
it coldly flows
With a mild, soft, and quiet motion:
Those streams that run with such a hideous
violence
Are still the shallowest; The silent waters
Are most dangerous.
If I have wronged you sir in such a manner,
That nought but death will expiate my
crime,
Let me understand my fault before I dye.
Beasts do not fight without their natural
parley:
I scarce have so much patience
As to tell thee: Thou had a sister.
And, hope I have one yet. What of
her?
Can thou remember her, and no
crimson Blush
S••in thy immodest cheeks? oh impudence!
When I remember her,
I have less guilt than I expected:
For if my wronging her my only fault is,
Heaven knows I am virtuous.
Hell is divine then: Less Tyranny is
harboured there.
If for to cloister up a sister be a virtue,
Let me be vicious Heavens: For to have killed
her
Had been charity; But to bury her alive
Where she must still consume in Loves hot
torturing flames
And never perish, is an act that Saints
All humane Malice. Know not me yet?
Know not Fidelio?
Fidelio! Let me embrace thee: I
must.
Keep off dissembling Crocodile:
Too long
Has the thought of thee already rioted in my
bosom,
Which now I'll banish quite: Prepare to
dye.
Hold yet your hand:
She is not in a Nunnery as you think.
Ha! Is she dead then? oh my mis∣construing
soul!
It is too true: Can I know it,
And let thee live a minute after?
Do not abuse your patience: She is
not dead.
What happy place contains her
then?
I know not that sir.
When that my Father did with bad success
Send unto Delphos, to demand what fortune
Should betide my sister, after that solemn
Contract
That was made between you, He received
from thence
This short but fatal Oracle.
Brabantas take this answer, and no other,
Thy daughter's born to disinthrone her
Brother.
These words did so enrage my Father,
To think his own bowels should root out
His own posterity, that nought but
The immurement of my sister could assuage
his Passion,
Which shortly he determined to perform;
But she, the night before that dismal day,
The silent darkness helping her escape,
Departed from the Court; But whither
I am uncertain, for my raging Father
Supposing me the plotter of her flight, next
day
Did banish me his Kingdom, on pain of
death
No• to return without her.
First to Pelorus I begun my voyage,
Which then I found all drowned in tears,
Lamenting your departure, which as I heard
Her late supposed immurement had cause.
Long there I staid not, but sailing onwards,
The tempestuous Sea cast me unawares
On this unfortunate Kingdom; Where I
shall never find her.
And would thou carry her
back again
To her imprisonment? Oh! the unconscio∣noble
Cruelty of a Brother!
Do not deceive your self. Heaven
Knows
My thoughts are innocent.
Talk not of innocence false man,
It is a virtue which thy childhood ne'er
could boast off,
Thy tainted blood runs thick within thy
veins,
And I must vent it, lest it prove dangerous.
Twill prove as clear as crystal
In token of my Innocence: No silver wan∣dring
stream
Shall with a purer current flow, than this
My unpolluted blood shall, to invite
Thy guilty hands, to wash them of their
stain.
There I could bathe eternally, and
never faint.
Prepare. Have at you sir. So cunning?
Hold: What had I forgot?
For this same crime Fidelio I will not dye
Innocence is wronged in it: I'll give thee
A juster cause for thy Revenge, thy sisters
Will:
Here in this letter it is enclosed.
Letters to me from Thesbia? art sure
The enclosed injunctions are to kill thee?
Her threatening brow at my depar∣ture
told me so.
When I received them, me thoughts her
face appeared
Like to a quiet stream crisped on the sudden
By some gentle wind, which soon, too soon
Arose to Billows; Then her tongue
Proclaimed me vagabond, commanding me
to find
My sister and her Brother, or near to see her
more.
Thou wilt grow odious to all the
world.
She loved thee once Virtusus, and ever would
Had not thy virtue failed, for which
If now she has sent thy doom,
Millions of Armies shall not hold my hand
From acting a Revenge, that shall puzzle
All the Furies for to second.
Never did guilty Prisoner at the Bar
Await the sentence of the Magistrate, with
such
A Holy and Religious fear as I do mine.
See how his clouded brow
Already dooms me guilty: Such another
look
Would save the Executioner his labour.
Oh cruel sister! Would have
me pardon him?
Think thou he is innocent? the cruel
Leopard
Is less spotted.
The News?
The Prince Charastus is returned
from Court,
And does desire a speedy conference.
We'll wait him instantly.
But good sir, stay not; The affair,
He says, is very weighty.
My sisters pleasure, and the Kings
affairs
Defers our combat till some other time,
mean while
Read this enclosed Letter, my sister sends
it thee,
She'll not the Proverb break,
Love bids us write what we are shamed to
speak.
Why so sad Arontas?
Can the Honours lately conferred upon you
Make you forget your wonted liberty?
I am already weary with their bur∣then;
Fate has converted my felicity to a wicked∣nos
So horrid, that the Ghosts of injured Kings
Will for ever haunt me.
What desert in thee can procure
So Royal Attendance?
Hast thou not heard then of that
cruelty
Which will for ever record my name
Amongst the Tyrants?
I yet am ignorant; Prithee inform
me.
I tremble but to think on it.
The Kings of Pachynus and Pelorus, going
to Delphos
To consult, about the finding of their late
lost Children,
Were by the last unfortunate Tempest
Cast on this Shore.
What of that?
I▪ bound by my new got office, and
the hopes
Of future honour, presented them to the King,
Who, contrary to my expectation, has,
As Spies, condemned them, le•t by their
flight
The world should know the Tyranny of his
cruel Laws.
And must they dye then?
Most certain.
Surely they must not.
Why? what should hinder?
The people.
Heavens keep such thoughts from
Scicily.
The People? they resist Authority?
May they not oppose a Tyrant?
Take heed whilst they oppose one
They introduce not thousands. Be confi∣dent
The ruin, spoil and rape of Innocence
that attends
But one such single act, will be far greater
than
The malice of ten Tyrants can ever perpe∣tra•e.
Though Innocence may suffer for a
while in it,
And much too, Yet we shall at length be
free.
Never•, Oh never. Op but that
gap once,
And ten thousand unseen miseries will enter.
Those whom the People dote on so, admire,
And saint for seeming virtues, if they once
get power
(Heavens having stamped that curse still on
such changes)
Will turn the greatest and the worst Tor∣•entors.
Oppression in a lawful King, is but a kind
of wantonness;
But in all others, a Necessity. No power, I
must confess,
There is without its whip; but the usurper
Lashes with Scorpions.
Then we can change again.
Most likely sir you will.
Change will beget a change, till All are no∣nothing.
Rebellion is a Circle that will find no end
Till men want Ambition, or the People,
Madness.
What must we do then?
Keep close unto that sacred rule of
strict obedience.
Though Tyrants reign, one grave, or age
may end it;
But Government let loose to change, and
popular disorders,
Contracts that ruin which nothing but
eternity can bury.
I find it a sad truth; yet would these
Kings
Were saved though. I am strangely trow∣bled.
No King can fall, but good men
•inde an Earthquake.
Shall we to Court, and see the event?
Lead on, I'll follow. Oh Allegiance,
Thou elder child of Virtue, Lend us thy
passive fortitude,
With that high Saint-like goodness arm
this Nation.
Resistance ever brings a swift damnation.
My Lords, the King commends
him to ye
In this Message. He bad me tell ye,
Ye must prepare your selves for a Noble,
Sudden, and a fatal entertainment.
What does his cruelty entend to do
now?
No more than Tarquin did to the
Poppeys
When he lopped their stately heads off.
Must then our Heads go off?
No sir; They must be cut off: My
worship
Is appointed to execute that honourable
function.
Base peasant, has thy Master sent thee thus
To jeer our Misery?
Good words sir, I shall be a cruel
Destiny,
And have three cuts at your thread of life
else.
Thus dares the baser Ass revile the
dying Lyon.
Hence thou unnecessary Parenthesis of Na∣ture,
Or by my just anger, thou shalt be our Har∣binger.
I am gon, but shall return in Thun∣der.
Oh ye powers!
Whore's that Majestic•• glory, which to
Kings
Is still e••entiall? where is that awful power
Which our least Nod may justly challenge?
Surely you have but flattered us, else Peasants
tongues
Could ne'er thus triumph o'er our Misery.
Be patient Great Brabantas.
Oh it is above my patience, that we two
Whom the All-potent Gods have framed
their Image,
And have given as equal power to rule in
Earth
As they in heaven, should thus be mock't by
one
Whom Natures over-charged breast has vo∣meted,
And made a drossy lump worth nought
But scorn and foul reproach of purity.
Kings are Earths Gods, how dares the baser
sort
Profane their Deities?
Most Royal firs, no sooner did your
sad estate
Arrive ou• Knowledge, but it raised
Pity within us, so far, that being bound
By the Religion of our office, and the com∣miseration
Of your Miseries, we thought it fit to visit ye,
And p•ascribe some necessary comfort.
There is no comfort left beyond my
miseries.
That name is banished quite; my cr•me so
horrid is,
That all the infernal torments will be
But my deserved penance, and no punish∣meant,
And the enduring them but my devotion,
and no sufferance.
Oh reverend Fathers! there's such a crime
Lies burdening my sad conscience, that to
relate it
Would affright your ears, and puzzle
Your Inventions for a penance.
Let not the defect of a sufficient pe∣nonce
Make you irreligious; Heavens mercy
Is above your crime.
Had there been ever sin of such an
exorbitant nature
For their mercies president, I might be con∣fident;
But now to hope it, were flat impudence.
The crying voices of my injured children
Are too clamorous for any prayers of mine
To arrive there.
No question sir your Childrens cries
Are Mediators for you. They will but
prove the steps
Whereby your prayers may easily ascend:
It is their filial duty.
Ought there to be a filial duty
Where no paternal care was? Such goodness
Would but aggravate my crime; should they
But plead for me, how wicked then were I
In wronging them? oh sirs!
Is it not a crime most horrid, when a father
Shall immure his daughter in a Nunnery,
Because a foolish Oracle did say, she was
born
To disinthrone her Brother?
Will not a careful Husbandman
oft-times
Cut off a branch, because he sees it may of∣fend
Some other? Necessity compels oft to
cruelty.
And he is mad that will not part
With a corrupted limb, when it may prove
Injurious to the whole body.
But he is worse that kills himself,
Because he wou•d not dye. Shall I
For fear of drowning from a well rigged ship
Leap down into the waves? This is
Wilfully to court, that which I fain would
sh••.
Your Son sir I perceive in this
Was chiefest Author; It was his accursed
fear
That made your tenderness to use
Such rigour on your daughter. Though him
you father,
Father not his crimes.
Would have me still heap sin on
sin?
Is not the ruin of a daughter an offence
sufficient,
But must I rob a Son too of his Honour,
And make a rape of Innocence my Relaxa∣tion?
My soul already is replenish't, I need not
bring
Vice in a newer fashion: Had he been guilty
He might have rested safely in Pachynu•.
No more: It is enough Virtusus.
I would my eyes were fountains
Fraught with tears, that I might ever
Weep for joy at this thy safety.
My Son Fidelio, welcome to my
Arms;
Now let me dye Bermudo, for thus supported
Dare I stand out braving Fate, and make
Death cremble at my boldness.
Arise my son; Let all the blessings
That the Earth can give to mortals, light
on thee:
That thou may safely flourish and spring up,
When this same withered trunck's blown
down
By ag•s Tyranny.
Tri•le not time▪ Great Sirs.
Take these our ill beseeming robes, in these
You may escape the Keepers curious eye,
And pass all undiscovered.
But how will ye escape then?
Leave that to Heavens and us.
D•spur it not: I pray make haste.
Heavens be your guard then.
And yours.
Oh Virtusus, Pardon my infidelity,
No thought of mine was the first that cause
That •whole suspicion of thy Loyalty,
Only the ill-sounding Trump of same▪
Blew some such speeches to my ears, which
they
Too suddenly entertained, and would as sud∣denly
Have banished, had not some envious tongues
Then seconded it. That friendship which
before
I vowed, shall now be' established;
I have called a Parliament within me,
It is now confirmed by Act. Fool that I was
Ever to mistrust thee.
Hark, tic done; Charastus now I see
Thou are truly faithful.
The Lodge is fired, the Keeper's
gone,
And I am pursued.
How? pursued?
Time will not give us leave to talk
on it;
Make haste, and save your selves.
What tumult's grown in our disturb∣ed
Court?
Will not the heavens permit me for to take
One peaceful hour, But must they still
Molest my wearied senses with these dismal
sounds?
But heavens I thank ye: ye have now awaked
And summoned up an almost forgot Revenge:
The slow paced time is now fulfilled in which
The two proud insolent Kings are doomed
to suffer.
Hark: Surely the Gods already have pre∣par'd
a fire,
And do expect the Kings for sacrifice.
Still more and more; Look out Arontas.
What should these flames portend? what
secret mystery
Is in Fate, that passes thus a Kings capacity?
Be it good or bad, speak it ye powers;
Speak it in thunder Heavens: or if
The affrighted world must still be ignorant
of its ruin,
Let some gentle wind whisper it to me alone:
Why should Bermudo be denied to be Fates
Councellor?
If it be treachery against me you would con∣ceal
thus,
Be speedy in your plo•s, I will unfold um
else,
Unlock fates Cabinet, rip op the all-con∣taining
breasts
Of the inscrutable destinies, where thus
I'll dissipate them all. Ha!
Why tremble so my breast? wilt never be
refined
•rome that terrestrial passion? Are not my
thoughts
Too crowned? Must they still live
In base subjection unto fear?
The cause Arontas, quickly?
The Porters lodge, most gracious sir,
Fired by a malicious Shepherd, caused
These sudden accl•motions of your Subjects.
And was that a fit subject for their ri∣diculous
shouts?
Now I perceive they are weary of my go∣vernment,
Else my danger could ne'er beget their mirth.
The mirth proceeded at the Shep∣herds
Apprehending:
See where he is.
Justice most gracious Sovereign. Ju∣stice
I desire.
It is Treason to suspect the contrary.
Which was the Author of the flames?
Of that your great Authority must
inform you,
For both were taken flying, yet but one
Was seen about the Lodge; which that one
was
By examination you may easily find sir.
Be assured we'll do our best: it con∣corns
us nearly.
In the mean while fetch you forth the Pri∣sonars.
Your Highness will shall be obeyed.
When the severer hand of Justice
menaces destruction
The innocent oft trembles, when the guilty
smiles:
How often has my doom beat terror
To affrighted Innocence, yet these two
Conscious persons, which must upon no∣cessity
expect
Its fatal fall on them dare arm themselves
With impudence, and suffer their audacity
To outface my justice, appearing rather
My Judges than my Prisoners.
Are all good manners blotted from your
memory?
If that the horror of my Justice cannot
Beat down those stubborn flood-gates, yet let
Your guilty consciences make room for
showers
Of penitential tears to wipe away
My hovering severity, or it will fall as una∣voidable
As deadly. When heavens thunder speaks
The senseless Ash will bow his head in a true
Submissive reverence, but the stubborn Oak
Unmoved refists their threatenings, and with
soaring pride
Advances still his branches; But oft times
we see
He pays a fatal forfeit for his impudence.
So shall ye.
He stands to be suspected sir that
basely fears.
Who would commit pure and undefiled
Innocence
Unto so cowardly a protection?
Who dares be vicious, dares be im∣pudent
in denial.
That is an essential part of Villainy;
He is but a poor proficient in the Mercurian
Art,
That frames not an excuse before the Plot.
Excuses sir we have none: There is
Too great a contrariety twixt innocence
and them,
One breast cannot harbour both.
That Innocence which you so falsely
to you
Attribute, is but an excuse it self, or other∣wise
It would have dared the utmost of suspicion,
And not have cause such timorous flight.
Does not the Lamb the sacred Em∣blame
Of happy Innocence, make haste away, if he
once spy
A ravenou• wolf pursue him? and yet his
flight
Ought not to raise the least suspicion of his
virtue.
The dismal noise of Fire worse than a ra∣venous
wolf
Followed our ears, which made us I confess
to fly;
But whither? only to your Court sir.
Had we been guilty, we never could suppose
Your Court to be our Sanctuary;
For he is mad, that having slain the husband▪
Will seek protection in the widows house:
We had been far worse, that having fired a
Member,
Would dare to take refuge in the body.
Will ever the timorous Hart fly unto the
Hue•la?
Or the harmless Dove meet the pursuing
Falcon?
Mercy most gracious Sovereign,
Mercy I desire.
Where are the prisoners sirrha?
They have escaped, my Liege. Mer∣cy,
oh mercy.
Escaped? Speak it again villain.
They have escaped. Oh mercy.
Escaped? what treachery is hatching
in the infernal Pit?
What damned Magicians has the Furies sent
To stupefy a Kings divinity? ye heavenly
Powers,
And you diviner Providence, yield,
Yield your precedence to Hell,
From thence proceeds the Master-piece of
plots
That justly robs you of Supremacy. Escaped!
It was as easy for a Lamb to escape
From out the paws of a half starved Lyon,
Or for a damned body to return from out
The jaws of Acheron, had they not been
More than mortal. They were Devils, dam∣ned
Devils,
Sent from Hell to jeer me;
Had they no other shapes to personate but
Kings?
Must Divinity become a cloak to Treachery?
Oh ye Gods restore um back again,
Or take your Bounties.
Good my Lord, this passion ill be∣comes
your Highness.
I am mad Arontas, stark mad:
Fury like lightning feeds upon my soul.
Good Heavens send down some ministering
Spirit
To divert this flame, or I shall fall
Armed with an universal ruin. Hear me
Ye just powers, It is I, Fates Fate, entreat ye.
And art thou come blessed Spirit? why now I
see
The Heavens are but our wishes Instruments.
Hail glorious Saint, thy charity has robed
thee
Of thy excellence: Thou that sats't en∣throned
Amongst the Deities, filling the heavenly
Quires
With thy Harmony, whilst with thy notes
The em•lous Spears jarred in confusion,
Why hast thou vouchsaf't to lay aside Dive∣nity,
And visit poor and undeserving Mortals?
Mistake him not my Lord: He is a
Mortal,
Sent as a Present from your Subjects
That guard the confines.
Thou art blind, old man, I can per∣ceive
Divinity within him, the least part whereof
Will make a monster of Perfection. Nor
shall I
Think him less than he does seem to be,
Unless his courteous voice proclaim it.
Let no supposed excellence in me
Make you an Idolater, but if you see ought
In this poor fabric, worthy this Admiration,
Admire the Deity that did infuse it:
Give not the cr•ature the Creators due.
If beauteous sweet thou art mortal,
as yet
I am not fully satisfied, Tell me thy name
and Country.
Anthrogonus men call me sir.
Pelorus is my native Country.
Oh happy Country that can boast
of such a rarity!
Look here effeminate men, ye that with im∣partial
eyes
Adore a thing called woman, here, here
You may find a difference; but I have too
much lost my self.
Revenge bids me retire. Jailer, were not
thy head
Too base to answer for two Kings,
I'd make thee an example to succeeding
times
For such neglectful villains.
Oh! good my Lord! my Lodge wa•
fired only,
That I being bufie in the quenching it
They might escape.
Thou promptst me well, Shepherds
confess or dye.
He that confesses sir an undone crime,
Deserves the punishment of the sacrilegious,
Honour, that Holy and Religious Mystery, is
defiled in it,
And if they be punished in the highest na∣ture
That rob a Church of some divine and holy
ornament,
What punishment deserve they that take
away
Divinity it self, and make a rape of their De∣votion.
Honour a household God is, which removed
Destruction surely enters.
Not confess then?
Oh Allegiance, whore's now thy former
glory?
Me thinks I see thee buried in the earth,
Crying aloud for vengeance on these Tray∣tors.
Rest quiet soul, I will assert thy cause,
And wreck thy vengeance in a full effusion
Of blood and horror.
Once more bold Shepherds we'll vouchsafe
to ask ye,
Will ye confess the Author? we may be
merciful.
I'll not belly our Innocence to gain
your mercy.
Let me be tortured with all the torments
That timpanized cruelty swel'd to the height
Could ever yet invent first.
Let him have his will in it.
Away with him to Tortures.
Oh spare his life great King; Spill
not one drop
Of his pure innocent blood. It is worth thy
Nation.
Let him confess then.
I will confess what ever you will have
me.
Did thou not fire the Lodge then?
Alas I did not.
Jailer away with him.
I did, upon my knees I did.
Believe him not great King: it is this
accursed Policy
To rob me of the glory of my sufferings.
Shall I no• be believed then? Stay,
you need
No witness, when you have one really con∣selling.
It is confessed you see great sir,
what would you more?
Be now a King and pardon him:
Rigour becomes your petty Magistrates that
know
Nothing of their Authority, but oppression.
A Throne's a Mercy-seat, and he that sits
thereon
Ought to distribute it, where ere he sees
True penitence, that's promised by con∣fession.
Peace Anthrogonus,
He is not worth thy pleading for.
Those better spirits that ascend
Will oft look down, and wheresoever they see
Virtue oppressed, will vouchsafe to help with
pity.
I do no more, I pity him, and spend
Some tears, and prayers, a poor boys been∣volence.
Thy tears Anthrogonus have prevailed▪
My adamantin heart melts at those showers.
He shall live. And be thy prisoner only▪
No more.
Come, we'll be for Martial sports: The
Boar
We'll hunt to morrow. Prepare our javelin•.
A King like a Colossus stands, over striding
fate
Whilst envies sails swel'd with ambitious
winds
Floated between his legs, and cracks her
Mast
With Admiration only at his height: No
Fate
The true Nativity of Kings can calculate.
NOt one tear more I'll spend for
thee my sister;
It is a grief too light to solemnise thy exe∣quies.
My heart in silence shall weep blood, when
I remember
Desdonellus fate. Hence then eff•minate tears:
Ye are too soft an expresser of my misery,
The senseless Trees but struck in favour by
the Sun
Will do as much, and shall I when fortune
darts
Her real beams of malice, express no great∣er
sorrow?
Yes, an inward bleeding is most dangerous,
That, that I will learn to practise.
Fidelio! Let me embrace thee.
I do contain more worth within these arms
Than Atlas bears upon his shoulders. Speak
dearest friend.
Where is Virtusus? living or amongst the
dead?
Alive too, but in prison.
I'll free him instantly; I'll have my
Crown again,
Too long Bermudo has usurped it. I'll break
upon him,
Like some di•efull Content sparkling my ven∣geance
About his Throne, or like a swelling champion∣nel
lone• damned up
Will I discharge my streams on all sides of
him,
Rushing forth with a strong and hideous tor∣rent
As mischievous as irresistible.
Forbid it Providence. Be not too
rash fond man,
R•l•gion, and your sacred Laws oppose it.
You have indulged him all the Prerogatives
of Majesty,
Crowned him your self, and should you now
Lay violent hands upon him before his
Crown is forfeited,
How would you violate your Laws, and
scandal
Your Religion? Think what an easy presi∣dent
Twill be hereafter to your Subjects.
Far be it from me to violate Reli∣gion:
I would not for the worlds vast Monarchy
Receive the mortgaged Crown before its for∣feiture.
I'll wed Flavanda first, so doing
Religion seconds my attempts, and restores
The Diadem again unto me.
Still you grow rasher: will you for a
Crown
Receive a Serpent to your bosom? His
Sister?
Will all your glory, and your high swollen titles
Make constant her that loves thee not.
Take heed, there's danger in it, great danger.
Her Love's more constant than the
Rocks,
Less blasted with the puffs of vain Ambition:
Nature has lost the mold where she was
framed,
And cannot second what she did:
It was my Flavanda whom her curious hand
From all eternity strove to make perfect.
Were she the e•act piece of Curi∣osity
that ever
Admiration doted on, yet if she want a soul
Able for to govern all those excellencies,
We cannot stile her perfect (Perfection be∣ing
The unity of both most excellent) our Loves
Like to our selves are still terrestrial,
Reflecting only on the outward object,
Without regard of that divine and most ce∣lestiall
Fabric of the soul We think
Those seeming spots within the Moon, mere
motes
And blemishes, when indeed they are most
pure,
And most pellucid; so on the contrary,
We deem all virtuous that is fair, and yet
The Moon is fair we must confess, yet she
Is only constant in Inconstancy.
Can thou look virtuously on any
thing that's fair?
Cans't thou behold dame Natures Master∣piece.
And no new Admiration swell thy enamourd
fancy?
Can thou but seem to court Divinity,
Or behold the Sun in all his glory, without a
true
And real Adoration? if so: Go court my
best Flavanda.
Carry a thousand Ovids in thy tongue,
Let thy words melt to the winning'st aloe∣quince
That ever enchanted Lady; Speak in thy
highest phrase,
Thou can not flatter her; she is as far be∣yond
it,
As I come short of admiration,
And if all this does produce a tear,
Or sigh, more than in pity of thy folly,
I will as much abhor inconstancy,
As now I dote upon her excellence.
I were injurious unto you, and to
that Deity
That lies enshrined within those rays,
should I
Presume to approach but with a virtuous
adoration.
No immodest thought shall once extract
An amorous glance, no rude word shall
preach
Uncivil doctrine to her, nor any melting
touch
Cast a delicious silence o'er her body, whilst
Her pleased eye retorts a second invitation:
All shall be truly harmless, all divine.
I'll lay a seeming •jig against her constancy,
And if she bravely can maintain that fort,
I'll stile thee happy in thy humble choice,
happier
Than those that wed 'bove their aspiring
fortunes,
Where every nod of the displeased wife
Clames an obedience in the Husband.
On to thy wars then, but take heed,
Fly not too long about those flames, lest that
Thy melted wings like to a second Icarus
Throws thee down into a deadly Ocean of
destruction,
Where thou must sink eternally: So Fare∣well.
Thine for ever Thesbia. If this be
true
I am above thee Fate. Why should I doubt
it? Her hand
Is the truest Character of her faith, her Seal
The firm and furest obligation of her Love
Which like the Gordian Knot binds most
inseparably.
It is that divinest Thesbia that has tide
Our absent souls together, reuniting too
Our hands though distant in as firm a Know•
As Hymen and his sacred Rites could do,
though present.
Be frolic then my soul; To day
Thou art wedded to thy happiness. Swell
high my blood;
I'll entertain my Thesbia in a dream:
There my delighted fancy may in spite
Of cursed distance, kiss its fill,
There in a second slumber I may lye
Melting my soul with hers, whilst cach em∣brace
Invites another, and each amorous look
Calls to a second Parley; There my ravished
senses
Rapt to the highest ecstasy may find out
New sorts of pleasures, and sweet fresh de∣lights.
Rest here then melting soul, to All good
night.
Did our chief bliss consist in worldly
pleasures
As Epicurus did define, I might suppose my
self
Most happy; But alas, take heed,
Trust not a Lyon though he •owns.
Oh ye powers! why did ye not!
When this same fabric lay like melted wax
Void of all form or feature, why did ye not
Frame it most miserable? why was I made
Beyond the reach of happiness?
I would Bermudo thou had ha•ed me,
I could have been ambitious then, and
Crowns
Are like Love, ne'er pleasant but in getting,
Once got, they are troublesome: Happiness
consists
In expectation only; Fond Gamsters when
they play
Desire to win, but having won, their play is
ended.
Sick men will please their thoughts with that,
Which to enjoy were deadly: Ambition
Were a virtue could 〈◊〉 shun the end.
What sleeping prisoner? Thou art happy
in thy thraldom;
Kings cannot sleep so soundly;
Where is my father Shepherd? where is he?
For whom thou endur'st this thraldom?
Cannot thy sleeps inform me? This Paper
may.
Ha? Amaze me not ye Heavens!
Do not abuse my too inclining senses with
the fight
Of this same flattering object. Oh desire
Thou art a false Optic misleading of our
fancies
To that sight which most we covet.
Why thus transformed Virtusus? Are these
a Princes Robes?
Is sleep a Lovers fellow? at noon tide too?
Then Thesbia is forgotten.
Sleep on sweet soul, she has deserved thy
scorns;
Let Quires of heavenly Spirits guard thy
slumbers,
And when thou walk let thy enamourd soul
Turn to those pleasing sounds: Thesbia
would have
No mortal Rival. Alas he wakes.
Stay Morpbeus stay, force not thy
leaden wings
So quickly from mine eyes: oh let me ere
behold
This Pleasing object. How has my fancy
Travelled all this while? what Seas, what
Gul•s,
What unknown Lands has my imagination
compassed?
If dreams those weaker fancies of our brain
Can work so really upon our souls,
Oh let me dream eternally, let all my life
Be one continued slumber: Ha? a Vision!
No, a real piece of Misery, one that
begs
Upon his knees a Courtesy.
Thou art my Jailer boy,
Thou may command it.
I not command, but my obedient
soul
Pores out it self in supplication: Because I
am your Jailer,
Let not that keep back your clemency,
I will become your fellow-prisoner rather,
Weep when you weep, sigh when you sigh,
And be the true and perfect flatterer of your
misery.
Tell me, oh tell me! whore's that unhappy
King Sperazus,
Whose life thy loss of liberty has purchased?
Long have I sought him up and down,
Yet still was so unhappy as to miss him.
Would thou betray him then false
Boy?
Far be it from me, I would but chide
him only;
Tell him he was cruel, inhumanely cruel,
Cruel to his own dear daughter,
Robbing her of that affection by his strict
command
Which she had placed on Prince Virtusus:
Nor was this enough to satisfy his ire,
But he must force her to revile him too,
(Heaven knows too much against her will.)
How oft poor maid has she with showers of
tears,
Distilled from those never empty fountains,
Prayed that the heavens would set an ever∣lasting
seal
Upon those lips that uttered such a propha∣nation?
But they reserved them for to sing in heaven,
As now they do.
Is she dead then?
No, she lives in heaven a sacrifice
Unto Virtusus ire.
I have heard too much: Hence
Night-Raven
Hencethou black interpreter of death,
Haste to the Stygian shades, be never more
Here heard on earth: Thy voyee will blast
us all.
I am sorry sir—.
Hold, stop thy accursed Mouth;
Let it not breath such dismal vapors:
Haste unto Pluto's Quire, there let the Man∣drakes
voice
Yell forth his Matins; Howl there the
Dirges
Of tormented souls; Learn Harmony from
Toads.
Yet hear me.
Never, oh never.
Thus often Politicians with their
too much care
Turn what was perfect to a just despair.
Call you this place a Cottage, it is a
beauteous
Palace rather, adorned to entertain some
Deity;
Art sure? and Nature too has met to make it
A per•ect Paradise: I have lived in ignorance
too long;
Courts are false Optics blinding our weak∣er
fancies
With a false and basely forged felicity.
This is the truest happiness.
Now I perceive things are most sweet
Known by their contraries; Courtiers
amongst us
Are had in admiration; we whose simplicity
Can be but honest only think flattery virtue.
Some one knocks, prithee admit
him.
One from Charastus Madam desires
To speak with you.
From Charastus? come you from him
sir?
Pardon me if I express a greater pleasure
Than modesty will allow me: How does
that Prince?
Alas, I fear all is not well you look so
strangely.
Is he alive or dead? speak quickly, quickly
gentle •ir.
Release me of this fear. Why are yo•
So cruelly silent?
Admiration Lady stopped my speech:
He lives,
Lives happily in contemplation of your ex∣cellence▪
Does this same visit sir proceed from
him?
No Lady: my devotion bound me
hither
With as great a zeal, as Pilgrims to their
Pilgrimage▪
For since Charastus tongue that poor inter∣praetor
Of your worth blazed your perfections to me,
My heart would never be at quiet
Till my ambitious eyes were witnesses of
that excellence,
Which now alas I find of such a full authority,
That I am forced to adoration: Thus low
I offer up my self unto your mercy.
Oh be as gentle then as fair,
And let some showers of pity quench those
flames,
Or cruel love worse than a flash of lightnin•
Will consume the Sacrificer, Altar, and the
Sacrifice.
If showers of tears could quench the
flame
I would be full of pity, but Loves fire
Is of that nature that the more we strive
To quench it, the more it still does burn.
Pity its fuel is, and should I spend some
Tears,
It would raise a strange presumption in you
Of an ea•ie Conquest; I'll not deceive
Your hopes so much: Charastus sir has con∣quer'd,
And is of force to keep. I am only his.
Only his? Good ought to be com∣mon
still:
Do not, oh do not, sweet, confine a happi∣nos
To only one: Make not a stealth of Natures
bounty,
But like some gentle stream running betwixt
two fields
Be a delicious ornament to both.
The twining Ivy that ascends
Embracing the loved Elm will oft vouchsafe
The encircling of some neighbouring bough,
and yet
The Elm cannot accuse it of inconstancy.
To suffer our affections so to wander
Were but to prostitute▪ and make common
that
Which nature hath reserved within for a
prize
Due to the most deserving.
The Sun himself ne'er stands upon
curiosity,
But lends his beams to all: He ne'er rega•ds
desert.
Be wise Flavanda, know he that woes thee
Is a Prince, the Prince of great Pelorus
Whither he shall car•y thee in as full a Tri∣umph
As he would his Penates.
There thou may shine in all thy glory
Whilst thy Beholders melt to see those
rays,
And never seek a shade to shelter them,
Whilst here you stay, the Tyrants Law
Worcester•e than a grossly exhalation dulls your
beams,
Not suffering them to shine at all, no not so
much
As on my friend Charastus.
With what face dare you call him
friend
Whom thus you strive to ruin? Can you
suppose
He will forget this injury? Surely
He will ever hate you for it.
He will rather love me for it:
Atheists themselves love Atheists, and shall
we,
We of so pure a faith maintain a hate
Against one another for being of the same
Religion?
How injurious should we prove unto that
Dei•y
To whom we pay this reverence,
Should we but think her mercy lay confined
Within the circumscribed bounds of con∣stance,
Or suppose that that love can ere be limited
By a promise which Nature has made free;
Love rests not in a point, it is large,
Diffusive as the Ayre, not like a stream that
still
Tends to the Ocean, but like some wandering
flood
Which at the will and pleasure of the Spring
Returns unto her bosom: Draw part, Sweet,
Of that wandering stood to this side of the
fountain,
Here let it come in a full effusion,
I'll meet its pleasing Billows with a virgin
Love
That yet remains unstained, unproffer'd, un∣polluted.
〈◊〉 Thou lie, false man,it is stained,it is
proffered,
And polluted too.
Nay, blush not, Sweet:
Thou'lt make Aurora blush to see her self
out-gon
In her peculiar excellence.
Let not this crimson have a colour∣ble
mistake,
It is a red flag of just defiance against thy
Treachery.
Recant fond man, thou wilt grow odious else,
More odious to me than my evil Genius:
I shall abhor thy sight till penitence
Has washed away this profanation. Dearest
of Friends,
If ever thou wilt do a favour to Flavanda,
Haste to Charastus, Tell him this man's dis∣loyalty.
He surely will severely punish it.
I obey most willingly.
Now She's gone, I am not what I
seemed
The base abuser of thy constancy: No saw∣cy
flame
Burns now within my veins, It is a religious
fire,
I cannot stile it love, but zeal.
Why did thou sweet suspect me? I was
Too confident to be a Lover: Loves flames
burn high
Still trembling with their height;
Mine were too base, and too audacious▪
Be happy now Flavanda, ere that too more∣rows
Sun
Shall deck these meadows with his beams
Hymen shall join you to Charastus. I was se•t
Not as his Rival, but his Instrument.
This Boar has mist us strangely: I'll
see
Whither I can trace him in the woods.
No sign at all? It is strange: Where lies
the wind?
North or North-East? He must needs be this
way.
what foot is that? It is fresh and new∣lie
printed.
Ha! Guard me Diana: A Rape, a Rape;
Where flies my ravished senses? oh
From what earthly cave proceeds this hey∣venly
harmony?
Dissolve, dissolve my soul, turn Air▪
And Echo forth those blessed harmonious ac∣cents;
A voice too? Orphans, Orphans, begst thou
again Euricide?
Let amorous Lovers take delight
And glory in variety,
Love still to gaze, though every sight
Ads still unto their misery.
I in a Cave
More pleasure have
Loving but one,
Than they that love,
Still to remove
Can in a Throne.
Surely the ground is holy where I tread;
The heavenly Choristers are met to day
To consecrate this wood, Eternal Mini∣sters
of heaven
If my rash foot has offended in the distur∣bans
Of your holy Ceremonies, blame my rude
foe•rune.
Oh let me not wander here in admiration
thus,
But send some gentle Air to be my guide
Out of this pleasing Labytinth: Oh Diana
Take pity on your servant.
What voice calls? Art thou a ta•∣ling
Echo?
No.
No? what art thou then? Art thou
some gentle Nymph
Inhabiting these woods? or art Dianas self?
Dianas self?
Most gracious Goddess of these silent
groves,
Long has thy servant lived the poor admirer
Of thy excellence▪ long has he lived in igno∣rance
Of that glory whose true worth to know
Would surfeit Admiration▪ Tell me, of
tell me,
May thou be seen by mortal eye?
I.
I will no longer live in ignorance.
I'll seek thee in the deepest caves,
Search the remorest corners of the wood
To view thy splendour. Oh stay then Gentle
Goddess,
Fly not hence, oh stay I come.
Stay, I come.
Come not to me sweet Goddess,
I am not worth such favour: it is happiness
enough
For me to seek thee, though I ne'er should
find thee.
Oh come not then, I am thy servant,
I am Bermudo stay.
Bermudo stay.
Yes, with a zeal as fervent as the
Melting Bride expects the wished arrival
Of the Bridegroom.
Lye there thou sweet and sole com∣pinion
Of my mise•y, whilst I from out this solitary
Cave
Behold the so admired fabric of the Hey∣vans,
And then contemplate on their excellence.
Eternal piece of chastity, at whose
shrine
Pure Virgins offer up unspotted incense,
Lo thus prostrate at thy feet Bermudo lies
Offering himself a most unworthy sacrifice.
Alas I am betrayed: it is Bermudo.
I must dissemble.
Beauteous Diana, Goddess of the
woods
May I behold thy splendour? As yet I durst
not
Lest thy refulgent eyes should blind me for
presumption.
Oh draw a veil ore that majestic count∣nonce
I shall be blinded else with too much seeing.
Men's weaker eyes must not behold
Divinity in all its lustre: That were a sight
Too glorious, else Bermudo I would appear
to thee
D•ckt with divine, and holy ornaments,
B•t envious Fates sorbet that happiness to
man,
I must assume some other shape
Before thou can behold me.
Take any gracious Goddess so I may
see thee,
Could thou assume the Devils it would be
lovely.
I have thought of one Bermudo not
so terrible
Though bad enough, what think thou of
Desdonella's
The late dead Princess? thou hated her
alive,
Her shape then surely cannot ravish thee.
Shall I assume hers?
Oh any gracious Goddess, any▪
Arise Bermudo then, Look up,
Behold in Desdonella's shape Diana; Speak,
Am I not very like her? Ca•'st not perceive
Her tear swollen eyes, her trembling hands,
And love-fick countenance? Look I not
Like a true and perfect Lover?
Oh Desdonella were thou now alive,
I should admire thee;
Thy shape was never lovely until now.
Thou art transparent grown, I can perceive
Divinity within thee, the reflection whereof
Dissolves my frozen bosom, and makes me
stand
Like to a burning Statue, all on fire,
Why tremble so Bermudo? can
Desdonella's shape
Of late so odious, make thee tremble?
Fond man, whore's thy Allegiance to Diana?
Wher's now that chastity which so oft
Upon mine Altars thou hast boasted?
Pardon Divinest Goddess; no loose
desire
Causes this sudden alteration, no upstart slame
Makes me forgetful of my loyalty;
It is not the outward shape that I admire,
(Though I must needs confess it is excellent)
There's that within clameth an Adoration,
And I were worse than sacrilegious should I
rob
Divinity of its due.
Look no more thorough that false
optic, fear;
••e not so timorous; Divinity is laid aside,
And I am perfect mortal, come, 〈◊〉 consident,
And kiss our hand; why so fearful?
Now for this favour you'll report Diana is un∣chaste.
Let me be blasted then; I were more
impious
Than superstition, should I think a kiss or an
embrace
Could be a breach of chastity; Those are
rewards
Given to afflicted goodness; but what merit
lies in me
Whose just worth from out the center of
your
Chaster mercies may extract so great a favour
I must confess I know not, unless I take
Your liberality for the cause.
I am so far from being ungrateful
unto him
That harbors but a spark of chastity, that I
suppose
The favour of our hand, a poor
And trifling recompense for so much virtue;
But should I offer up a lip to you Bermudo,
You▪ would be civilly fearful, thinking me
Unchaste to offer it, and your self
More impious to receive it.
I were erroneous should I think so;
Will not the Sun oft-times vouchsafe
An humble salutation to the earth, and yet
not lose
One of his chaster glories; far,
Far be it from me to think, when ere I see
Approaching beams of Chastity, that I may
refuse
To meet them with an equal ardour:
When I consider that the unity of two chaste
bodies
Makes chastity entirely perfect, I dare put on
A confidence to salute a Deity,
Provided always our intents be chaste.
It is not an outward ceremonious action
That can spot the soul, for could we sin
And think but chastely, it were no fault.
Armed with which opinion I am confident,
And dare taste the sweetness of that lip,
And think it lawful too.
Ou• impudence; That kiss has pulled
a ruin on thee.
Hence from my sight, make haste,
Lest my pursuing vengeance overtake thee.
How near my Virgin-modesty was forfeited?
Who can look virtuously with affections
eyes?
Beware ye vesfall Virgins, ye that do make
Your chastity your Religion, beware of too
much gazing;
Eyes oftentimes dart forth a lustre
That will dull devotion were it armed
With all its sacred glories.
How fares it Royal Princess with
you
After this wished conference?
As with a •eary Mariner shipwreck
in the Haven.
Many a tedious voyage has this wandering
bark
Past in the gulf of desperation, yet still was
ever
Lost in the port of happiness; oh Halisdus!
I am grown weary with this sailing;
Is there no other way for to be happy,
But by this most unfortunate adventure?
Yes Madam, if you'll be advised. You
know
On what condition Bermudo holds his
Crown
Just now with you broke it; If you please
then
I'll tell your brother of the forfeiture, and so
To save his life he will condescend unto your
will.
Accursed policy to shun a rock
And fall amongst Pirates; Far,
Far be it from D•sdonella to enjoy that love
That comes by composition; that were an act
Becoming those that set a common price on
Chastity,
And sell Repentance unto Prodigals.
True love admits no hire, tic Lust not Love
We bargain for. Grant he has sinned,
Ought I to punish him: Will ere the Leo∣pard
Chide the Ermine for being spotted? That
were
To blame their own deformity in another
Without excusing of themselves.
Thou art too virtuous Desdonella:
None I can blame for the misfortune but thy
virtue.
Oh ye powers! Is this that just reward which
virtue pays?
All will hereafter strive for to be vicious
If excellence must merit misery. Come
Desdonella
I'll to thy Cave, and furnish all thy wants:
Thy virtues glories had they their perfect
light
Would puzzle all eternity to write.
Where am I now? what make thou
Constantine here?
Alas I am come to do a Message,
And have forgot my errand; oh ne'er re∣member
it.
Coldest thou forget ever, thou mighst be
happy.
Thou must accuse Fidelio; Thou must dye
first:
Though he has sinned, thy tongue shall never
punish him.
Oh Fidelio thou art false, false as inconstan∣cy
it self,
False unto me, and to the worlds vast expo∣ctation
too.
Is this the melancholy life thou vow'dst so oft
To lead in Lelybaeus? why did my soul
Leave her religious Sanctuary, Country,
friends, and all
To see thee court my ruin in an unknown
Land?
Should I now chide, and seek Revenge,
I did but Justice, It were equity
No Rigour should I kill thee.
I cannot be so much a woman; oh ye powers
Why made ye me so soft, and him so cruel.
Hail gracious sir, these so dejected looks
Speak you Charastus: I have a message to
you,
Would but your eye suffer your ear to hear
it.
Why do you g••e so? has your divining soul
Fore-told the happy tidings that I bring you?
If some instinct has forestalled my errand,
I shall not need for to relate. I'll only tell
you sir.
You have a friend, by name Fidelio, a Man,
(A •in rather where scattered virtues ga∣ther'd
up
Lye hoarded in a comixed unity)
If ere perfection was, it is in him. He Sir
Has spoke your cause so •eelingly to Fla∣vent;
Pleaded with such divine and holy Oratory,
That her love now blazes with such violence
As I could wish you presently would see her.
Divinest closu•e of a soul more pure,
No general pardon sent from Heaven
Could strike attention in me with so great a
zeal
As thy commanding voice as don; dearest,
Dearest Flavanda can thou suppose a poor,
And silly garment can keep me from
The discerning of thy excellence, that knew
it,
When I lay a misshapen Embryo in the
Chaos?
It is not a silken cloud, Divinest, that can hide
the Sun.
You do mistake it sure.
This is a Meteor only, reflected from the
true one.
Those rays are too too glorious
for reflections,
They cast a lustre would make
An Angel of Ae•hiop, would not their heat
Convert him to his wonted colour.
Nor can I think such beams can meet
But in my dear Flavanda: Art thou not she?
I prithee say thou art, twill ease me some∣what.
Your reason sir will tell you that I
am not.
Make me not m•d I prithee: can
there be
Two most excellent, two most rare,
Two chiefest above all, it is a mystery
Beyond two worlds: The Sun admits
No partner of his glory, the Phoenix no
partaker,
Why should not she the chiefest of all wo∣men
Assume the like Prerogative? Must there be
A divided essence of an united excellence?
Oh Nature! why did thou give to man,
two hands,
Two eyes, two Affections, and but one heart?
Pardon divinest Lady if my too much care
Has made me negligent, there is
A direful conflict fought within me by two
friends,
Either must have victory by my ruin:
What will that victory yield.
I see you are disturbed sir;
I'll crave leave to return.
Thus does the Sun fly our Horizon,
This Night clad in a misty veil,
Spreads darkness o'er the world,
Whilst mortals wander in obscurity.
Oh Love, thou are too much a wanton;
Thy sport's too serious. Who fires a
Church
Or kills his parents may be happy,
Repentance oft will wash away that stain,
But he that loves, loves doubtfully as I,
No tears, no sorrows, nor repentant sighs
Can wipe away his misery, but he must dye
Starved in the midst of plenty.
Why so sad Charastus? prepare your
ears
To entertain news that will startle all your
Melancholy thoughts, and make you pam∣perd
appetite
Swell high with contemplation of a happi∣nos,
Flavanda's constant, more constant
Than a miser to his gold; The vestal Virgins
At their Altar may be tempted, but not she.
Oh Fidelio thou hast abused my trust, I
Sent thee not to praise my constancy, but to
try hers;
Did thou not promise me to court her,
Nay court her in thy chiefest Rhetoric,
To use all the persuasions that thy tongue
Could in civility pronounce?
And so I did, by all that's good, I did.
Thou swearst not by thy self now:
He is not good that's false unto his friend.
Why stird'st thou a suspicion in me of her
constancy,
Yet ne'er would seek to prove it?
What Dev•• has inspired thee with
this falsehood?
It was my better Angel rather
Sent from Heaven to warn me.
Did thou not flatter me? extol my loy∣alty
Beyond its merit? Tell her each figh I spent?
What tears her love had cause?
But that I know she is constant,
I should suspect her for thy praises.
If thou believe Charastus there is
faith
Or loyalty in Fidelio, (which surely thou
oughtst not to suspect)
I tempted her as far as piety and friendship
Would permit me, yet like a steadfast rock
she stood
Throwing the insulting billows on the mo∣verse
face.
Oh Charastus thou art happy;
She is a gem incomparable, and did I know
What envious tongue had blasted thus our
reputation,
I'd make it eat its venom.
If thou but heard, it thou would
start,
And stand amazed to hear such sweetness.
Do not delay your joys with her
E•comium.
A Priest and your Flavanda does expect you
For to tie that Knot which you before
Too rashly would have don, had my unlucky
hand
Not hindered it.
Alas Fidelio the tide is turned;
If now you wed me tic unto my grave.
From my divided heart springs a biforked
flame,
Hymen will stand amazed to see it, and will
not tell
At which to light his torch at.
Farewell Fidelio, death he needs not fear
That does desire to meet it every where.
Oh Love thou art too cruel! How
can thou tyrannise
Ore his too soft nature? Had thou but eyes
Thou then would pity him, but as thou
art,
Blind and obdurate, thou shootst at random
still;
So fortune guides thy shafts, and always she
Upon desert spends all her cruelty.
THe lying Painters picture aged time
With wings it's heels, as if he always
flew,
But that their licence warranted their acts
I justly might accuse them of their falsehood;
The time that Love obeys is slow, exceeding
dull,
Hel'd back with leaden fe••ers.
Each tedious minute makes a week,
Each month an age, and each delaying year
Seems fully a Platonic.
Whither despair dost hurry me?
What new found death can thou invent
For an inconstant Lover? If there be one
Which never yet imagination compassed, let
me enjoy
Its wished virginity, I have deserved it fully.
T•lk not of death Charastus now;
my arms shall be
Thy living sepulchre, my Bed thy winding-sheet;
Hymen shall write thy joyful Epitaph,
And Virgins pure shall 〈◊〉 an Epithala∣mium
for an Elegy;
We two like to two meeting channels will
turn one,
One individed and united Body.
Oh Flavanda I blush to see thee;
I am a villain grown, yet I still dearly love
thee▪
I am inconstant, Dearest, c•n'st thou think it?
The ficklest fortune is more steadfast:
The wind oft-times is stable, but my heart
Wavers at every object.
Have I a Rival then Charastus?
Is the stream of your Affection then divided,
And your Love grown less?
Not less Flavan•a; Streams parted
with a stop
〈◊〉 with a greater violence 〈◊〉 her side,
Than when they k•pt united in one channel.
I 〈◊〉 •on••ss my unwo•thiness; I
will resign
Unto thy ••ether love, could I but think her
worthy.
Never, oh never, never shall it thou
do it.
For sooner sure the Gods can separate the
orbs
Th•n our so long united Hearts.
Were the separation but in Natures power,
here comes
Those rays that easily would make the dis∣solution.
Thou hast made a worthy choice
Charastus.
I glory in my Rival more than Lovers in
their Nuptials:
This Act confirms your love to me, and
should I dye
I make no question but my lifeless trunk
Would pleasure in your happiness; no •o•i∣embrace
Could ye exchange, but I should be partaker
No kiss without a joyful blush from my wan
cheeks
Should join your tender lips together.
Delay not then your joys for me.
My Love is old and stale; He•'s fresher
Than the maiden Rose whose pure•ess ye•
No boisterous hand has touched profanely.
I'll imitate those friends that take more
pleasure
For to see some feed, than if they fed them∣selves.
I'll starve before I'll taste such cares,
They will infect me with inconstancy▪
They're like devouring flames, they still
turn
All they meet with to their own nature:
But I will fly them worse than stings of Score∣peons,
Or that deadly root, that pallateth the eye
But poisons still the palate.
Shun not approaching happiness for
my sake;
I am grown old in his affection, and Age
You know must dye, yet when I am dead
Be not I 〈◊〉 jealous of my Ghost.
If death can end this controversy, it is
fittest
I should yield, when I am dead
I happily may love him, but never living.
Contend not so my hearts two pa∣rallels
For what's another due; Death my desert is,
Here I live, like to a needle twixt two Load∣stones,
Paying a trembling reverence to both,
No full Allegiance unto either.
Oh ye individed moities of my soul,
Tear not my heart with your attractive fire∣tues
Thus by piece-meals, divide it gently,
Ye both are victors of my better part al∣ready,
My body is not worth your quarrel.
Nor your heart; we night as well
Quarrel for fortune, she's as constant.
But not so lovely.
Constancy the only beauty is in
eyes
That true affection governs, which till Cha∣rastus
Gets again, I shall abhor to see him.
Would I could do so too; But envy∣os
Fate
•wharts my desires, and condemns my hate.
Do I yet live? remain my senses
perfect?
Oh I could rave, tear out my traitorous eyes,
Dissect my heart, and rend affection from af∣fection.
Surely I am mad, because I am not mad:
Mad men enjoy their happiness, but we
In having reason know our misery.
Where is that boasted constancy
which so oft
Men use to glory in? where is that Faith,
And that eternal Loyalty, which once ex∣altered
men
'Bove Demi-Gods? Is there not one left fire∣tuous?
We might have been inconstant by Ado∣rity,
Custom would have allowed, it but men,
Whose purer souls should harbour most dive∣nity▪
Are now become less constant far than we
That claim no being but from them.
Why should we suffer then for what's ano∣theirs
fault?
My act shall work a reformation in the
world,
And man, not woman, shall hereafter be
The Proverb to express Iuconstancy.
Kneel you to me Lady?
Wonder not Fidelio why thus low
An unknown Virgin offers her obedience;
It is a reverence that we ought to pay
When we behold such virtue, and should I
Be so uncivilly modest to deny an adoration
When duty and affection bind me,
The world might justly stile me irreligious.
That modesty I must confess is in∣civility
That smothers an affection; But what worth
in me
Can stir affection in your chaster breast I
know not,
And I must needs Lady either be a fool
In extolling of my self, or uncivil in con∣damning
your Judgment.
I look not on you sir with superstiti∣os
eyes,
I cannot make an Idol of perfection,
It is your souls Idaea I admire
Whose excellence I have studied long
Taught by your Constantina's praises.
You have chose a most unprofitable
Subject
For your study Lady, it is so sparing of re∣ward
That it forgets it self, and must for ever,
you.
It is a study like the Chimick,
The end I must confess is hard to gain, but
yet
It shows most sweet conclusions to the endue∣strious.
Many there are that study it with delight,
But none with such a fearful fervency as I;
Yet though I tremble, I despair not, since she,
That only had the power to obtain it,
Has resigned it to me for a Legacy, which I
may
Justly challenge, and you may not without
imp•ety deny.
A Legacy? if she be dead that was
Sole Mistress of the Art, the Art m•st dye
too.
Mistake me not, she is not dead sir,
She has usurped another study only, called
Obedience to a Husband, for Constantine•
your once betrothed
Is now married to the Duke of Florence my
only Brother.
She is worse then, her constancy is
dead,
And with it dies my love eternally.
Oh say not so; that was my Legacy
given to me
By her departing Constancy, and if the Laws
fulfil
The wills of wicked men, it is fit that sacred
Constancie's
Should be obeyed▪ She told me here you lived
In Lelybaeus a disguised Shepherd for her
sake,
Which made me take this journey and this
habit,
And surely had you not a fresher Love,
You ne'er could disobey your Constantina's
will,
Especially to one so like her.
I must confess thou art so like her,
That I should believe what thou hast said is
true,
Were I not so confident of her Loyalty.
Shall I not be believed then?
Let her hand persuade you, since my tongue
cannot.
This is her seal and Character, I
know'um well;
The direction, •o her wronged Fidelio.
I begin to tremble, my gelid blood
Flies fast unto n•y heart, a•d ca'ls for avenge∣ance.
Read and repent false man.
Oh heavens! Why of those number∣rous
torments
That attend our sinful actions, chose you a
woman
Yo torment me? If that my crime so hai∣nous
was,
That all your malice joined with fortunes
Could not invent a punishment to equal it,
Hell surely might have furnished you,
You needed not have called a woman to your
council,
Their malice is above H•ls hate,
But I'll be revenged on, all their Sex,
For none I am sure is constant since she is
false.
Be not so confident of our weakness:
The loving Turtle shall not serve her mate
With half that faithfulness as I will you.
Hence Ethiopean Devil; Thou art
too like her
To be good: I'd rather meet a Succubus,
Embrace a sooty Moore, or dally with a
Negro's horrid curls.
They may by chance prove constant, but
thou
Wilt presently deny thou love me.
Let me dye eternally, if ever I deny
I love you.
Then follow me to Bermudo, thou
shalt be the first
I'll sacrifice to my just anger. Oh men ac∣cursed!
Oh thou restrainer of our wilder
actions,
Thou that keepst in awe all raging superflu∣i•ies,
Teaching sobriety to the grossest Epicures,
Coldest thou restrain our wandering image∣nations
too
Thou were a Paradise, but they in the obe∣scurest
places
Wander most, and in the darkest Caves,
where light
Ne'er yet vouchsa•t an entrance, oft will see
A perfect splendour and a full effusion of im∣material
Beams
Descending down from an impenetrable po∣stern.
Thoughts are the Devils chiefest Instru∣mints.
The holiest Friar in his seclusest Cell
Oft sins in imagination; The purest Vestal
At the Altar will oft-times fancy a thing un∣lawful;
And should that be the utter ruin of Fire∣ginity,
Where should we seek it Heavens?
See yonder he is, Great Sir.
Thou art a courteous Jailer; He
sares
More like a Prince than Prisoner.
I love not Sir to triumph over Mi∣sery.
Shepherd, thou hast thy liberty.
The importunate entreaties of Anthrogenus
have commanded it.
See now thou goosed, and with submissive
knees
Be thankful to his bounty; It is
But a poor gratuity for freedom.
I scorn that freedom that is given
Not for desert, but out of courtesy.
Flattery a thraldom is beyond a Prison,
And I abhor it worse; I'll not thank him
Nor Heavens for what's my due sir.
Why stubborn fool? What merit
lies in thee
Whose just power may challenge but a favour
from him?
It was not thy desert that raised this pity,
But his Charity.
His duty rather: true goodness
Whensoere he se•s oppressed Innocence
Is bound in duty to relieve it.
Is Innocence the ground of your pre∣sumption?
Shepherd beware lest thy contempt
Kindle a flame that will consume thee.
Thou hast stirred the embers, without pre∣vention
Twill be dangerous.
Oh smother it a while, Great Sir;
Let it not spend
As yet its violence: He will accept your
courtesy,
I know he will▪ It was not He, it was
His modesty that refused it; See how he
blushes Sir.
Gentle Shepherd, dye not ungrateful to our
bounty;
That crime will blot your former innocence,
And make it seem as loathsome as impiety.
If against me you do conceive this Hate,
Go but with me, and I'll tell you sir
She is not dead, Thesbia is not dead,
And reconcile us two in a perpetual league
of friendship.
For once I'll try your cunning.
Shepherd choose which you will have,
A perfect freedom, or a sudden grave.
I shall have both in either.
Hast thou Bermudo with ambitious
wings
Soared 'bove the reach of common thoughts?
Have I obtained that happiness which
proudest envy
Scarce can pry into? And must I stoop
Unto a boys soft Lure? Surely some holy
power
Conceals it self within that pleasant habit∣tion,
Whose awful noise freezes my raging ap∣petite,
And tu•ns my fury into Charity.
The hardened Earth made stiff with
winters frost
Views not the Sun with such a full alacrity,
As I your Highness.
A lustful couple joined in loose em∣braces
Hate not the approaching Morn with such
an enmity,
As I your flattery.
Believe me Sir I cannot flatter you.
My simple honesty leaves that study unto
them
That seek preferment by it: I never hoped
To raise my fortunes by my handsome lying.
The zeal I bear your laws has armed my
confidence,
And I do wish I had a thousand unchaste
Damsels
To present you for a sacrifice.
And I do wish if this be true,
I had ten thousand favours to requite thee
with.
My duty Sir, and not those hopes of
recompense
Has bred this hate, which death shall not ex∣tinguish,
But my angry Ghost shall hate um in Eli∣zium.
The very name of woman is grown odious,
And I abhor a Lovers sighs worse than the
air
Breathed from infection.
Let me contain thee in my arms thou
faithful Champion;
We two will grow together, and be one,
One terror to that foolish passion.
I have not earned such favour yet.
I would not willingly receive my hire
Before I have deserved it: Let your Re∣avenge
Eat of my labours first; I can present you
With a taste, a woman, that dares outface
Impudence it self, who in despite of all
your Laws,
And that, which lately I did count
An ornament of woman, blessed modstie,
Is turned a shameless wooer.
If this be true, I'll wear thee here
My better Genius; Long have I sought out
such a one.
To make their sex more odious to my eyes,
But ne'er till now could find one.
Conscience that food of fools and bane of
Greatness
Has abused me still, making my subjects
To conceal those crimes, which had they
but revealed,
My exercised severity ere this
Had bred a Hate, more deadly to their Sex,
Than raging Dog-dayes, and Platonic
men.
Thou art an honest subject, Shepherd, thou
preferst
Thy Kings content before that Bug bear
Conscience,
For which, ask any thing, it is thine,
Ask Monopolies, I'll seal um all, yet do not,
They are the rewards of flattery, and can∣not
Equal thy desert.
Your favour Sir will far exceed my
merit.
Hast any witness, Shepherd, of the
fact?
Yes sir, I am his witness;
I know she loves him, Loves him as her soul,
And were there but a thing more dear unto
her,
She would love him better.
Oh Audacity: This is she.
She? Unto what height of impu∣dence
are women grown?
Dare thou defend thy crime, that thou art
grown
So confident?
I come not Sir for to defend my
crime,
Or to expostulate with your Highness, for if
I did,
I then would tell you, she that loves most
truly
Ought to be thought most modest,
And that affection if but constant does as far
Exceed your chastity, as Chastity, Inconti∣nonce.
Bold woman! Hast thou forgot thy
Sex?
I think I have, for I cannot dissem∣ble
now,
But what I say, proceeds from Truth
Great as thy Tyranny. I flatter not your
Highness,
Such common Courtship let them use that
are
Afraid to dye; My resolution shall out brave
thy rigour,
Use then thy full Authority.
Who waits without?
Convey that Strumpet hence, ere that the
Night
Sheds Poppeys on the Earth, she dyes.
Now I shall dye in charity with all
Since thou art merciful: For this same cur∣tesie
Bermudo
Whilst I live, I'll pray thou may repent,
And when I am dead my obsequient Ghost
Shall wait upon thee still to put thee in re∣membrance.
Shepherd, this courtesy has fettered my
revenge,
My raging few•y feeds upon this fuel with a
devouring appetite,
And if thou add•st not still unto the flame
Vengeance will lack his prey, and f•ast on
me.
Proceed then in thy holy work, and sooner
shall each sense
Forget this Organ, than I my pious instru∣meant.
Whither so fast Fidelio? How fares
it friend?
Well.
That well sounds ill me thinks.
Is this the joy you give my liberty?
Had thou received thy freedom so,
The calmer Seas when Halcyons breed
Should have appeared more boisterous than I:
I'd not have frowned to see thee free,
But if some billows did by chance arise,
I would have turned um into dancing waves
For joy of thy security.
Alas Virtusus, I am glad to find thee
safe, but
My afflicted soul cannot express the joy.
Oh see not my heart swelled with revenge
Extend my stretched out sides, and can
thou hope
For any thing but frowns?
Thy looks I mu•t confess declare a
Passion,
But of what nature I am ignorant.
If thou ha•t lost thy penetrating eye,
Look upon my face, and there my eyes
Sparkling forth fire for anger, will give light
to read it by.
Can not conceive it yet? See thou not
woman there
Imprinted in the wrinkles of my frowing
forehead?
Oh woman, woman, woman!
Come, forget this passion for a while,
Forget all women, and their virtues too.
Alas there is not one left virtuous,
but are all
As false and as disloyal as thy sister.
I hope you don't suspect her sir.
Yes, and your Mother too.
One man could not beget two contraries:
Thou art too good to be her Brother, and
she
Too bad to be Brabanta's daughter.
My ears have sucked in poison, which
works
Like Stybium in my brains. If this be true
(Which yet I cannot credit) nor piety nor
sisters cries
Shall hold my hand, but I will sacrifice her
blood
For an atonement to thy anger.
Oh Virtusus it is too true: would
thou rip op my heart,
There, there thou nightst behold
Disloyal Constantine writ in bloody notes;
There too as in a perspective thou should
see
The Duke of Florences lustful eyes
Fixed fast on Constantine, whilst the amorous
Girl
Plays with his wanton hair, and in
A thousand other ways invites embraces.
Should Heavens in thunder speak it,
I durst to contradict um.
Twill be a less impiety to contradict
this paper.
It is her seal and Character:
I'll read no more; would it were her body,
Thus I'd rend it; Thus would I tear her
unchaste limbs,
And blow um like to Atoms in the air;
Thus in contempt I'd spurn her lustful face,
Bowl with her rolling eyes, and twist her
hayr
In •ops for executions. Did I but know
What vein her blood inhabits,
I'd make a sluice and draw that channel dry
Though I lay drowned in its gore.
But I am too passionate; who fury can allay,
Vengeance may sooner, and securelier pay.
Oh Charastus, never till now unwel∣come
to Fidelio.
Thou art too happy now for my companion.
I have dissolved thy Loves ambiguous Rid∣dl,
And given thy soul a free election,
By making a necessity of thy choice.
False and disloyal man, da•'st thou
yet live
And glory in thy wickedness? Hast thou a
Conscience
Not to kill thy self when such a stain com∣mands
thee?
Oh thou profaner of all Justice
Ought he to live that cannot look upon per∣fection
But with envious eyes?
My care has not deserved these words
Charastus.
Call not that care Fidelio which thy
spleen
Too long has nourished, it is an inveterate
Hate
Sent from the fouler mansion of thy soul
To blast perfection: Is that Physician care∣full
That instead of Physic gives deadly poison
To his patient?
No dire mistake was author of my
charity,
But a Revenge which all their Sex must
tremble under,
And it was my fortune to practise first on her,
And her honour to precede whole thousands.
Thou art the worst of Mount∣banks,
they kill
Their poorest Patients for experiments,
But thou destroyst Patience it self, the rich∣est
Gen
That ever Art envied dame Nature for.
It is the nature of Revenge to punish
first
Those things from whence they took their
poison.
Poison from her?
Herein thou show thy venomous dispose∣tion:
Spiders suck poison from the sweetest flow∣ers
When Bees draw Honey. Her words
Though armed to my destruction seemed to
me
Adorned with more variety of sweetness
Than ere enriched our Hybla, more pleasant
Than the jucie grape stole from the Vine
Just at the entrance of maturity;
And can they then, can these delicious words
D•stilled to the invitation of a happiness be a
poison?
•Tic thy bad Nature only that converts to
vaught
What ere the Gods thought good.
Dote not Charastus so on one, whose
scorn
Makes her condition poorer than her birth,
Which surely is ignoble. The Kingly Eagle
Stoops not unto flies.
But yet a Fly mounted on Eagles
wings
Deserves more commendations than your
pairted Peacocks
That boast but in the gross absurdity of Na∣ture.
If for to reach a glove dropped from
A neighbouring Queen, be to degenerate
From Majesty?
What will the world report when they shall
hear
Charastus stooped to the meanness of a Shep∣herdess?
Art thou disloyal too Virtusus? two
such more
Would learn the Heavens impiety. Adieu
false friends,
Know my revenge shall be
Fully as ample as your Tyranny.
I dare, vie vengeance with thee at
the highest;
My heart's as great with rage, and less con∣fined
Within the bounds of charity, tic free,
Freer than Air, it soars aloft, hovering
Like some prodigious Meteor ore all women.
All shall groan under its heavy weight, all
must sink
Or all my ends will perish,
Not all Fidelio, be not so severe:
Out of
Those numberless thousands that do clog the
Earth
One may be found unspotted: thy Sisters
Virtue
〈◊〉 of sufficient value to redeem a destined
Hence•ombe
Of unchaste women, though doomed by Tie∣ronnie
it self.
I do suspect her too; she is too much
A woman to be good: Women are all
The fruits of drunkenness, begot when men
Like senseless beasts wallow in strange de∣sires;
Then coveting to frame a Monster like
themselves
Nature complying with their avarice, sends
them
A daughter: How can that Sex then be di∣vine
That's thus engendered betwixt Lust and
Wine.
Be more charitable Fidelio in your
opinion:
Blame not all for one.
Charity is cold:
Twill breed a contrariety in my raging
breast.
Give me hot fuel: I would be all on flame.
Feed me with Bridegrooms thoughts, and
let me drink
The fervent sighs breathed from the truest
penitence;
Bathe me in Lovers tears, dry me with
The fiery palm of some notorious Red-haird
Scrumpet:
I would be a living element of fire
To cross the new Philosophers opinion.
Yet from this flame I would send one spark
But to the ruin of a woman,
For now I find the Proverb's verified
He that begets a daughter surely went drunk
to bed.
Daughter this forwardness of yo•rs to
dye,
Makes me believe you are innocent, and
now I am
Grown confident that what you said is true,
Although at first I must confess it startled in∣credulity.
As grave Sir I am not bound with an
untruth
To wrong myself; so I do scorn
To mitigate my crime with coined excuses.
I must confess I am guilty of that sin
Which now they tax me with: If it be a sin
Chastely to love, I am most wicked, if not,
I call the Gods to witness I am innocent,
For no loose desire has ever yet profaned
me.
Thou art the purest Virgin living
then,
Purer than those that think all Love
An argument of looseness: Who ne'er knew
Wine
Cannot be thought abstemius, it is the for∣bearing
taster
That is temperate. She that is chaste and no∣ver
loved
Does only good compelled by ignorance;
But she that loves and can be chaste
Enjoys that virtue in its full perfection.
Such an one, divinest Maid, art thou,
Whom but to ransom from the Tyrants
Law,
I'd stretch my feeble limbs with vigour on
the Altar,
And with a zeal undaunted meet the flames:
So with them should my soul aspire
Beyond the reach of gross mortality.
And do you envy me that happiness?
Is not my soul as free as yours to expiate
Its own transgressions; The Gods I am sure
Desire a Sacrifice though spotted, if offered
By the repentant sinner, more than whole
Hecatombs
Bestowed by Innocence.
Thou pleadst divinely against thy self;
thy only fault
Is too much goodness, which lest the Hey∣vans
Should not know how to pardon, by want∣ing
of a president,
I'll furnish thee with showers of tears
To make a flood wherein thy soul may float
In peace unto security.
Reserve them for some other sub∣jest;
I make no question but to dye for him
Will be both penance and a pardon. Could
my heart
Be but so kindly stubborn to resist my
thoughts oppressions,
And no• break till I endure this martyrdom,
I should receive the joyful Crown of im∣mortality.
Let not the thought of that, divinest,
trouble thee;
Here is a juice distilled from Nepenthe,
Drink it,
And the remembrance of thy former mise∣ries
Will fly thy imagination.
Alas I dare not take it: my life
Is of so short a moment, that I shall ne'er re∣quite
you,
And I would not willingly die• ungrateful.
I owe both this and far more to thy
virtue.
Farewell thou mirror of all goodness;
Take these my tears, my prayers, my sighs,
Companions of thy journey, and when thou
art amidst
Those sacred flames, thy'l help to wast thee
to eternity.
Right heavenly Sir adieu.
Where were thy eyes Fidelio?
This will be news
Will make thy affrighted blood start from
thy veins,
And turn thee more pale than she consumed
to Ashes.
Now sails our wishes with a sted∣die
course,
The tottering bark poised by a seconds help
Floats safely on the Maine. But yet be not
Too credulous fond man, the balance is un∣certain,
And should that fail the shipwreck would be
deadly.
Trust not too much unto a friend; Oppor∣tunity
Base mischiefs Bawd to them is too obse∣quious.
Brutus could pierce great Caesars side
When Pompey could not; Mistrust then all
Bermudo,
Be intimate with none; It is State policy.
A Snake• though fostered in a Kings own by∣some
Will grow at length as mischievous as un∣controllable,
And pierce that breast that nourished it.
Ye silent Ministers of Night
S•nd your Cimme•ian darkness ore the
world,
Choke up the Sun with fogs and misty va∣pours,
Let it b• night eternal, or let my eyes
Drop from their hollow caverns, that I may
never see again
So gross impiety.
What fury does transport thee?
In what foul part lies my accursed
memory?
I'll tear it out, and be a lump of dead for∣fogetfulness.
Entomb: ye just Heavens within oblivious
Cave,
I would forget my self, my all, so with them
I might forget that wickedness
Which these my eyes were witness off.
What art thou frantic fellow?
Pardon dread Sovereign if my rage
His slack't my due obedience. Fury so
blinded me
I could not see those rays which from your
Majesty
Shoot in a continued lustre.
Oh Modesty whore's now thy ruddy wings?
Where is that bashful trembling which so
〈◊〉
I have seen adorning Country Mansions?
Why liv'st thou now an exile in the woods
•anisht from Court and City?
The man is mad.
I would I were great King so this
were •alse:
Oh Sir, your Court is spotted with such Lust
As can command a blush for ever in my
cheek to think on.
Ha! my Court?
Yes, your Court, that Holy Temple
Where Justice and Religion hand in hand
Walks in a happy unity, is now become
The sink of soul impiety.
My Court become a bro•hell house
of Lust?
These two unhappy eyes saw two
Melting in close embraces, Kissing each
other with such fervency
As if their lips desired to be united and be∣come
An individual happiness; Alas my chaster
tongue
Cannot express those amo•os tricks
Which their hot appetites belched out
To teach old Lust a new lasciviousness.
Swell higher yet my rage;
Thou art at too low an •bb to punish such
impiety,
Swell till your channels crack▪
Let a general inundation break the banks
And turn to ruin all it meets with.
Their two deaths cannot alone dissolve
This mass of wickedness: Thousands must
dye
To expiate this crime, if it be true.
It is too true great Sir; your eyes
Shall be witness of it, if you'll be pleased to
follow.
Lead on.
The holy absolution of the Priest
Sings not so glad a Requiem to my departing
soul
As this thy comfortable presence; Do not,
Oh do not then obscure thy self with ill be∣seeming
tears,
I shall suspect thou think me still unchaste,
And spend these tears to puri••e my spot∣ted
Conscience.
When friends do part but for a
week or so,
Their weeping eyes the emblems of their
troubled hearts
Will let fall tears, and shall we
That now must part eternally
Deny our souls that charitable sacrifice?
Thou a long journey Constantine now must
take,
Who knows whither I shall see thee more;
Alas poor soul, weep not for my fe∣licity.
It is a glorious place that I shall go too.
There in a golden firmament enameld with
bright stars,
Amidst a thousand Virgins I shall hear
Eternal harmony, still sounding, and still
pleasant,
There fragrant smells shall never cloy
My fainting appetite though still presented
odoriferous.
And can thou weep because thy f•iend
Must go to such a Paradise?
I weep not dearest because thou
goosed,
But that I stay behind; Could I accompany
thee,
No Vestal Virgins at the Altar should appear
With such a joyful countenance: But since
I here must live
A walking Ghost pent in an earthly sepul∣chre,
It would be impudence to refrain from tears;
Weep on then Thesbia, let thy eyes
Flow with a continued moisture, to drain
these fens
Will puzzle all projecting undertakers.
My weakness can resist no longer.
These tears proclaim thy triumph;
We two like two Niobes will shed tears
Till we become one Fountain.
See great Sir how close they are?
Oh do you start Sir?
Ha! Anthregonus, I would my eyes
were lightning
For to blast thy spotted soul, yet leave thee
still as fair.
With what affection they embrace?
See how their wanton heads wearied with
kissing
Hang like two drooping Lilies on each
others shoulder,
Their very eyes to sympathize with them
Melt into tears.
My rage involves a thunderbolt, this
poor thin cloud
Cannot contain it long; twill out to all our
times.
Oh Anthregonus little can thou think
What raging sorrows boyle within my
breast
At this sad spectacle; The sight of such im∣pi•tie
Feeds on my heart worse than Cantharides▪
Or the deadly sting of a foul Conscience.
My eyes shall be no more your Pander.
Take heed fond fools, Bermudo comes
Armed to destruction:
Thus climbs Revenge: thus her
aspiring head
One step has mounted, ere to the top it
comes
Your hearts false men shall feel its rigour.
Sleep on fond Boy, thou hast a soft but fa∣tall
pillow,
Had not Bermudo loved thee, nor thou saved
their lives,
Thou might have lived, but now
To punish three thou die.
Thus by degrees Revenge must rise
Who straight brings death knows not to tie∣rannize.
Alas we are betrayed.
I care not I since Innocence is my
guard.
Seize on that lustful couple.
Why this violence? ye needed not
have come
Thus armed to betray our innocence:
That weak resistance we could make
One word might have subdued, but if you
think
To f•ight us with your strength, know we
have
A guard above• us shall con•to•t your hopes.
Guilt's a s•fficient terror to it self,
It needs no addition; but Justice as it
strikes
So must it speak, like thunder.
Should it strike here, it would be
truly so;
The holiest Temples oft are struck with
thunder.
Should you but ta•e his Nature and destroy
So pure an edifice as his, it were no Justice
But profane severity.
Plead not for me: I dare his utmost
rigour,
In that he will be constant, and constancy I
love
Be it in cruelty.
My cruelty will but water when it
flows on thee.
Oh thee such tender years can be so old in
wickedness.
Had thou a soul A•throgonus as pure
As its enclosure thou mighest have been
E••h•on it a Deity for mortals to have won∣der'd
at.
Would thou yet live? There is a strange
Conflict fought within me, by Piety and Af∣fection.
Let not Affection pull a curse upon
you.
It is not in the power of your Majesty
To spare my life and take he•s, unless you
will be
More impious in breaking of your Laws,
Than you were pious in the making them.
It is true Anthrogonus, thou can not live
Without I violate Religion; Thy body
must
Within an odoriferous cloud ascend the
Skies
To crave a pardon for thy soul.
The Gods require no humane sacri∣fice.
Mercy if offered in a free oblation, is the on∣lie
incense
They delight in. I am enough to satisfy the
Law,
Make not Religion sir too great a Butchery,
Your pity and his repentant tears
Will be a sacrifice more sweet,
Than all the Cookery of humane entrails.
Witness ye Gods with what unwil∣ling
hands
I offer up this sacrifice; But Laws must be
obeyed
When piety commands, though to the ma∣cares
ruin.
Kings that make Laws to encrap others, may
With their own plots by chance themselves
betray.
IF thou wilt know a reason why I sent
for thee,
Ask of my heart, for that would never be
At quiet till I had seen thee,
But rolling still in my disturbed breast
Prompted my soul to dye not stained with
such forgetfulness.
Thy immaculate mind tells me thy
soul is pure,
I should suspect the heavens before its
whiteness:
The alabaster Mines helped by the Sums re∣flection
Cannot show a piece so candid.
I cannot boast its colour, it is a foul one,
And ere I dye, it will be one continued
spot
More ugly than deformity it self: There is
A crime that I must perpetrate, or else my
Ghost
Cannot rest quiet in its utne.
There is no crime so horrid, but thy
former goodness
Has made a virtue: One drop of poison
Poured into the Ocean, pollutes not the
water,
But clears it self and adds unto the stream.
Ingratitude is a sea of venom,
Which my malicious soul has entertained,
And most discharge her poison upon thee;
Thou that hast been the partner of my sor∣rows
Must now become the subject of my malice.
Thou can not find a fitter subject,
I dare
Encounter with the deadliest poison thou
can give
And think it a preservative.
Mine is the worst of venomes;
If thou but take it, it is not thy body only
That must perish, but thy soul too.
To what sure destruction do I run on either
side?
If I refuse to sue unto thee, I am ungrateful,
And if do, the same stain brands me still.
Can thou be inconstant? wonder not Fla∣vent
Why I ask so rude a question,
For by thy inconstancy, I must be proved
constant,
Thy weakness must be my triumph,
And thy disloyalty my eternal glory.
To ask thee now whether thou could leave
Charastus
Were a Tautology as absurd as to name,
Flavanda
And most excellent, I know thou dost
Already understand me.
Yet I am ignorant for whom thou
pleadst.
I plead for one that loves thee with
an ardour
More fervent than Charastus, one that will
n•t waver
When he sees whole Chataracks of beauty,
much less
At the small suspicion of a feature. Fidelio
Is the man; which ought you to respect then
most
Him that left me for you, or you for me?
Be not mistaken Constantine,
That love that he professed to me was only
feigned:
Charastus sent him but to try me.
I prithee say not so; thou wilt undo
A Virgin with a truth; if he be constant,
How impious then was my suspicion.
When you were gon, he told his
treachery,
And with what plots he sought for to betray
me.
No more.
Thou hast returned my poison to the full;
The false suspicion of his Loyalty heaps sin
on sin.
My soul's one leprosy so foul,
That surely the flames in which I must be sa∣crific'd
Will against their Nature downwards tend,
And hurry me to Hell. Oh Fidelio, never
before
I wished thee false: thy constancy will be my
ruin.
Oh Constantine here shall my knee
take root,
Until thy voice denounce my sentence:
This penitence
Entreats no pardon, it is Justice rather Rigour
I desire.
Let this suffice
To show my duty and my penitence: could
I fall lower
My ambition to out-go thee in humility
Should force me down.
Kneel'st thou to me? the earth shall
not resist me,
But my obedient soul shall pr•ss me down,
Till nature bids me stay, lest I should
Violate her Laws by falling upwards.
Thou can not kneel Fidelio and I
stand,
When the Sun is down, the exhalations fall:
Arise, and I will personate those vapours.
Thy sentence must dissolve my fro∣zen
joints
Or I shall fall again: Can thou forgive me?
Can thou forgive me?
No, I cannot; it lies not in heavens
power
To forgive where none is guilty; A pardon
Does belong unto a Conscience stained with
wickedness,
But thou art innocent, so innocent
That the purest Crystal will confess some
spots
To see thy whiteness.
To make me clear, prove not your
self disloyal.
Or you inconstant are, or I more stained
Than misbelieving Atheists with my incre∣dulity.
Thou art become more glorious by
thy incredulity:
Thou could suspect, and yet be virtuous.
Thou thoughtst me false, yet loved me still,
When I upon a supposition sought Revenge,
And most unluckily obtained it.
Yet I was Author of thy crime:
My foul suspicion was thy sin• sad pr•sident.
Thou make my sin appear more
horrid:
Thy suspicion was but the confirmation of
thy constancy,
And were that a President to me
How wicked then were I for to be vicious
Because thou were virtuous.
I cannot conquer you with argue∣mints,
yet
In civility you must yield: contend not with
a woman;
That victory will be no glory surely;
You must not sir deny me that: See,
My soul pours out it self in a petition.
Weep thou Constantine: I'll
plough the earth,
And sow those precious seeds, •ee'l have
A crop of Pea•l, more glorious than the Ore∣entall:
Venus shall have a neck-lace of these Gems,
Dianas Virgin Zoos these beads shall beau∣tifie,
The other Deities shall labour in our Har∣vest,
And think one seed a pay too prodigal.
Weep Sweet no more, thou hast shed enough
To purchase immortality, I prithee weep no
more
Lest I be forced to sow my Tares
Among that heavenly •rain.
How well those drops become them?
the pleasing dew
Adds not a greater lustre to the Rose.
With what a sweet variety they slow?
How prettily they spo•t in method?
Alas! one knocks Fidelio.
I will not wake to hear him. Tell
him
I say I will not: in this sweet slumber
I'd not disturb the Heavens with a petition,
Or should they call, I would refuse to hear
them.
Most noble Shepherd, the King
expects you in the Temple,
For to s•e the sacrifice, and you fair Shep∣herdess
(I am 〈◊〉 I must become so sad a mizzen∣ger)
Must presently prepare to suffer.
Never did voice jar ho••ser in my
ears,
Oh what a hellish sound it leaves!
Hells three mouthed Porter joined to Scyl∣la's
quite
Cannot howl out so sad a Message.
Prepare to suffer? What is that?
Comment on those sad words sweet Hey∣vans,
Unsold that hideous mystery: I dare not
think
Upon the exposition •s so horrid.
Know thou what it is to suffer?
Yes, it is to dye, and be immortal.
Death is the common •ode to im∣mortality;
men
Whose lives abhorred all virtue but Ripen∣tance,
In abundant troops, flock by that common
High-way,
And shall she whose Virgin soul no thought
has blemished
Find no unknown path peculiar to such ex∣cellence?
To dye a spotless sacrifice is a glo∣rios
path
Ne'er trod •n but by them whose Saint-like
presence
Still adds to its curiosity: The Altar is
no funeral Pile,
That melts its fuel into Ashes, but a re•ining
fire,
As gentle as those flames from which
The purified Gold receives it lustre.
Oh do not deceive thy self: How
often do we see
The Sacrifices perish, and ne'er return
More glorious by their sufferings.
It is true, that fire that cleanses but
the Gold
Consumes the drosser Metals: Had bea's,
Our common sacrifices, but souls confirmed
divine
By Innocence and Reason, we might adore
um
On our Altars without the blot of supersti∣tion.
If death must purchase immortality,
Thou must not, shalt not be immortal:
There is a debt due unto Nature for thy
goodness.
Live here an everlasting mortal then and
pay it.
The glory freely given unto this•t
Is greater than if purchased.
But who can give it? It is not in
Natures power.
She frames our goodness for the Heavens;
There I must live, hemmed in with happiness:
There no felicity will be wanting, but when
These tears makes me remember thee.
Let not the thought of me thy mur∣derer
Disturb thy happiness: I will revenge thy
quarrel to the full.
Something must be done: Farewell thou
heavenly Candidate▪
Thou hast a place selected amongst the De∣ities
Where thou must sit and teach the ignorant
world
That constancy, which none but thou could
ever boast of.
I shall betray a womanish passion in me
Should I stay longer. Farewell thou new
elected Deity.
My Tears so stop my speech, I cannot
Bid Farewell.
What weeping Constantine? Can
the fear of death
From out the circle of thy purest innocence
Draw such a saintness.
The senseless trees, Herbs, plants,
and flowers
In dewy tears lament the Suns sad absence,
and shall I
Deny that duty to Fideli• when a sad Eclipse
Must hide him from me to eternity.
Tears are not Amble•es of a saint belief,
The hottest days melt often into showers.
Oh Thesbia! my heart will break,
And cheat the Altar of its sacrifice.
Here, drink this Nepenthe's juice
then,
Twill ease thy heart, do not refuse it, the
Priest
Ju•t now bequeathed it to me as an heavenly
Cordial.
What had I forgot? See here's the
same.
Oh it was a Holy man; He would sain have
died
To save my life.
So would he to have saved mine:
Trust me
He made me weep to see his silver tears
Distill in such abundance from his eyes;
My dear, dear father could have don no
more.
Lets then on bended knees in adore∣tion
of his charity
Wish that the Heavens will never be in∣grateful,
But •ill shower down on his deserts a due
felicity.
Upon our knees we wish it;
And as this juice from our orecharged souls
Expels our miseries, so may his sorrows va∣nish.
It is down. My congealed blood late frozen to
my heart
Dissolves, and with a quick agility
Leaps in my new-fill'd veins. My thoughts
have pleasant •uell,
And every sense is ravished with an unknown
happiness.
I am strangely altered; I have forgot
The principal end of my creation, to be mi∣serable.
Come sit down, I have a great mind
To imitate the dying Swans upon Caiisters
Banks,
And sing my funeral Elegy.
Swell swell my thoughts, and let my Breast
Receive with joy eternal Rest,
Swell higher yet, faint not to see
The end of all thy misery.
Death's but a sleep,
Then do not weep,
But with desire
Embrace the fire,
So shall thy soul, so shall thy soul, aspire
Unto a place where it shall see
Etern•ll Crowns of Majesty
Attending on its pompous train
Uncompel'd, without disdain:
Then let not fire
Make thee retire,
Nor yet deny
This obsequy.
Lest in despair, lest in despair thou die.
Then let not fire
Make thee retire,
Nor yet deny
This obsequy.
Lest in despair, lest in dis—pair—
Thus ceased the dying Nightingale,
enamoured sleep
Delighted with thy Harmony stole the last
accent
From our ears. Thesbia! what has her voice
Hushed thee into a slumber too, and left me
here
The sole resister of its power? Sleep on
sweet souls,
And when ye wake, think it no pain
If ye be forced too soon to sleep again.
What means this silence Shepherd?
me thinks you look
As if you were at some most solemn •unerall,
Where the c•rps of an endeared friend is to
be interred:
These visages become that place; but when
you go
To •alu•e the heavenly Deities with your
f•ee oblations,
You must put on a far more pleasing count∣nonce
That the Gods may pleasure in your offer∣ings,
And delight in your burnt sacrifice.
My divining soul great King, foretells
An universal ruin in this sacrifice,
A general numness prompts my heart unto
a sad,
And deadly melancholy: Surely I have of¦fended.
Yes in thy drooping zeal. Come, let
not •ear
Hinder that devotion, which thou began
With such a noble resolution, to thy immor∣tall
glory.
I do conjure you Sir by that hate which you
Conceive against women; By your Crown,
by your Sceptre,
By all the Gods I do conjure you
To spare this humane sacrifice.
If you needs must offer to their Deities,
Surf• their Altars with the richest gums,
Fetch forth the Phoenix nest for an oblation,
Or•er the world lament the loss of all their
cattle,
Profane not thus their Altars with a wo∣mans
blood.
Thou hast won so much on me by thy
former service,
That to deny thee now were a most wild in∣gratitude
Did not the Gods require it: my vow to
Heavens is past
And cannot be recalled, to promise them
The malefactors for an offering, and then
Cheat um with a sheep or some such tri•le,
Is not to sacrifice but defraud.
The Gods ne'er feast on humane en∣trails,
Their Nectar is not mortals blood:
Think you their stomachs have so base an ap∣petite
To hunger after that which men do loath?
Repentance is their banquet, the steam of
fervent sighs
Their food, and tears not blood's the potion
they delight in:
Be not ungrateful Shepherd;
Strive not, for my love, to make me impious:
Justice and fidelity commands them for a
sacrifice.
Sacrifices must be pure, not spotted;
The fairest bea••s are destined to the Altar.
The sinner gets his pardon sooner
By his own sufferings, than if h'ad suffered
by a Proxy.
I did belie her Innocence, believe
me Sir
She is innocent, as innocent as the new-be∣gotten
child.
To purge a sin, oft-times a Lamb
must dye▪
And so shall she, our zeal will be the greater.
Rather your impiety:
Who offers up one Godhood to another ho∣nor?
Be not so irreligious to destroy that gem,
Which I adore, as a resplendent Deity
Sent from Heaven, to beautify the earth.
Take heed; Be not so fondly super∣stitious.
Thus to contract a Deity to a Beast.
A Beast! can Heavens hear this,
And no thunderbolt tell the proud King he
lies?
A beast! were thou armed with thunder,
Or were it but to see thee ten thousand
deaths,
Nor piety, nor Religion should withhold me,
But I would tear tha• venomous tongue out,
And hang it like a lying Meteor in the Air.
He grows frantic: Alas poor man,
He deserves my pity more than anger.
Where sleeps your Justice now?
Rouse up your drowsy headed Laws
To take revenge on him that dares their ut∣most.
Whence this sad Music?
Cease your petitions: it lies not in
the power
Of your prayers, nor his mercy to recall um:
Fate has deceived the Altar Sir; The Lambs
That should have been the sacrifice, are dead.
Dead!
Yes; Your threats great King has
proved
Their executioner: Imagination that unna∣turall
flame
Has not consumed, but broke their tender
Hearts.
Here you may see the ruins of those well-built
Temples.
Ha! Heavens vanished unto Heaven;
Why did thou steal thy death divinest?
Why did thy flitting soul post so away,
And give no warning to thy friends?
Hands off ye dogs, do not deny the Gods their
sacrifice.
Me thinks the Genius of the world doth
stagger;
The affrighted Earth turns round, and sends
forth
Foggy trees, in a continued lamentation for
its loss:
The Heavens stand still to entertain her ex
excellence,
And all the Planets turn to Constellations
With amazement: Copernicus, thy opinion
Now is verified.
Most reverend father, though cruel
destiny
Has abrig'd part of our triumph by their
deaths
Yet to manifest our duty, in all ceremonious
order
Let their corps be sacrificed.
I dare not Sir pollute the Altars
With a dead oblation: High Heavens will
be displeased
With our offerings; The very beasts abhor
the dead.
Let but their bodies be interred, &amp; then come
And offer a few prayers, and without doubt
The Deities will be appeased.
Your will shall rule us
Oh death, thou grand Commissioner
of Fate,
Seize these my vital spirits, since she is gon
Whose warmer breath so oft has nourished
them.
What! can thou not hear now Death?
Art thou grown astonished at thy late got
prize?
Assume he quickly heavens; Death will forget
His office else and let the populous world
Surfeit with multiplicity.
Did ever traveller so faint to see
The end of all his travels? Has all my wea∣ried
steps
Tended to this Home, and tremble I to be•hold
it?
Where be those pleasing smiles, those
wheeling eyes,
And that harmonious voice, which once did
call me, Brother?
Are all gon? Has death ravished thy Virgin
blushes too,
To adorn thy soul translated to some Deity?
That new star which the Astrono∣mers
of late
Observed in Cassiopeia, was but thy Harbin∣ger,
Sent to prepare that room to entertain thy
excellence:
There thou must set, Queen Regent of the
Constellation;
Oh be my Zenith ever!
Lend me thy influence to direct my actions,
And sooner shall the Adamant forget the
North,
Than I thy sacrifice.
What Justice would not stagger
To condemn such excellence? what Tiger
almost famished
Would not stand amazed, and rather starve,
Than make a prey of such perfections?
Why made her Nature of such
goodness,
And took no care for to preserve her?
Me thinks those lips, soft and as ruddy
As the purest wax, invites impression.
Heavens, be not jealous If I kiss her.
They're warm: a crimson blush begins
To beautify her cheeks, and says I was im∣mode••:
Oh Heavens! She stirs too; Now for some
glorious apparition.
What new fire burns my polluted
breast?
Whence come these unknown flames?
Guard me some chaster power; good prove∣dence
Redeem this Temple from a profanation.
Thou hast mistook thy way divinest;
Heaven
Lies not here; That h•s a narrow pa•h
N•re trod on but by virtue; Go, Knock
At Repentance gate, one rear of thine
Will easily compel an entrance: Thy
goodness surely
Is not ignorant, it is thy charity only
To enrich the earth again with thy diviner
presence
That has cause this wilful error.
If thou be here, I'll seek no other
path,
This is the only way my wishes aim at.
Keep off; The beams of thy divinity
Will consume me; I begin to melt;
My knees more stubborn than the Elephants
Bows down in adoration with thy lustre.
I cannot tell what strange effects
Sleep has procured upon my outward shape;
My thoughts are su•e the same, they have
Fidelio
Still they• subject, which makes me confident
That I am not changed, but still am Constan∣tina.
Thou art some Goddess rather, which
To appear more glorious has assumed her
shape;
Alas, the Heavens has stole her soul
For an immortal Pyramid, and it would be
Too great a prejudice to it, should it return
From such celestial happiness.
I am transformed in nothing but my
tongue,
That once was powerful to charm belief;
VVher's now its vain Authority? Thesbia
I prithee sweet awake, and tell thy incredu∣lous
Brother
That I live, yet straight must dye
Kilt with his most misjudging charity.
It is she; oh Thesbia my dearest
sweet, Awake
Awake, Virtusus calls thee; Depart not in a
dream;
Let not thy soul he ravished with those joys
Which heaven presents thee with; good sle•p
Be not so cruel to be eternal.
Tri•le not time Fidelio with these
Ceremonies;
Arise, it was only sleep cause by a potion
That deceived the King.
May I believe you?
Believe your senses, why so fearful?
She's no Ghost.
Liv'st thou Constantine? thou art so pure
I do suspect it.
What pleasing waves rocks my de∣lighted
soul?
How is it tossed within a gulf of happiness? Ha!
Let it float still, divinest, the ena∣mored
waves
Will be made happy by its presence.
Nay, fly not Thesbia from the Haven:
Here are no traitorous sands, no sudden
storms,
Nor unseen Rocks to ruin thee. All
Is as free from danger as thy wishes.
Why casts thou Anchor? Hop'st thou to be
securer
In that miserable Ocean? Oh Thesbia
Thou wilt raise storms in that securer Port
If thou deny an entrance.
Surely you do mistake me Sir.
Thesbia was a woman, and can you love her,
And think her so immodest to turn man.
Thou can no longer Thesbia lye
concealed,
He knows All.
Hast thou betrayed me Constantine?
Oh let me sink under my shames sad burden.
We'll sink together then; thou and I
Will be each others monument.
No more!
I hear Bermudo coming: true Lovers care
Will in possession o•t-times breed despair.
My Plots still fail, and all my shafts
Shot against resisting walls
Bring back a ruin to the sender that sacri∣fice
Wherewith I thought to expiate my crime
Fate has converted to a murder so horrid,
That I must sink, or get a pardon for devo∣tion.
Oh how my grovelling soul pressed down with
wickedness
Rolls like the imprisoned wind
Pent in the hollow caverns of the Earth,
Finding no vent to aspire, but still must lye
Under the heavy weight of soul impiety.
Repentance must redeem it from its thral∣dome,
a Ransom
Which I dare not think on lest envious Fates
Should turn that too into a wickedness.
The greatest are not still the best I see,
Kings are but crowned to fall decked with a
pompous infamy.
Ha! what dismal noise beats that alarm
To my guilty conscience? my affrighted
blood retires,
And leaves my trembling arms
Shaking like sapless branches at the Nor∣thern
wind,
My feet the Basis of this tottering Pyramid
Cleaves close unto the earth, whilst my erect∣ed
hair
Stiffer then bristles of a Porcupise
Stares in the face of Heaven: Oh I am
thunderstruck.
Ha! the easy stomack't earth vomits they
dead,
To tortors me; Am I environed round with
Ghosts?
Conceal me ye good Heavens;
Spread an eternal darkness ore the world,
That very sprights may wander still in igno∣rance:
VVrap my affrighted soul in a defence
Not to be pierced with apprehensions eye;
Make me invisible or blind.
Heavens cannot hide you from my
just revenge
Without the forfeiture of goodness: Murder.
That crying sin has like a power Spell
Summoned my scarce cold corps, not fully
settled
In my latest urn, to appear again on earth,
And force as accusation of thy conscience.
Mount mount my soul, and with the
swiftest winds
Fly to some unkwown Land, where the af∣frighted
Su•
Ne'er yet durst enter, nor the amazed Hey∣vans
Think on a place so horrid: where the cor∣rupted
air
Darts forth infection, &amp; the ulciferous winds
VVhiffs plagues to the inhabitants more
loathsome
Than the stench breath from polluted char∣nil
houses;
Where death surfeits his fatal arrow,
And each funeral Knell yield by a dying
Mandrake
Proves still the dirge of an ensuing frailty.
Is there no Sanctuary for a guilty conscience?
Let me then sink, sink to the Center.
Release those captive Giants Heavens, that
now groan
Under the heavy weight of mighty Moun∣tains
Hurl Pelion upon Ossa, and Olimpus upon
Pelion,
And all their fetters upon me, to press me down
Beyond the reach of Register: Let me not
suffer
In their Annals too, but let a sad mortality
Of Remembrance ceaz all succeeding times,
That I may fall forgotten.
Is this the way to expiate thy crime Bermudo?
Are profaner wishes thy repentance? take
Heed
Do not precipitate thy inclining ruin; Pull not
That hovering Justice on thy head, lest it fall
No less than fatal.
Thou blessed Idaea of a form divine, forgive
My rash devotion; ent•mbe Revenge a∣amongst
those
Sacred Relics, and let thy incensed ghost
Sleep in its peaceful urn: oh be as mild as
excellent:
Draw hence those looks, filled with such plea∣sing
horror,
And each succeeding day shall add
New Trophies to thy mercy.
Think thou my patient Ghost can
rest in quiet,
Whilst thy majestic cruelty tramples ore the ruins
Of my lost honour? Can I behold thy ambi∣tious
mind
Swelled higher with my suffering, and no pi∣os
envy
Seek to abate thy triumph? shall wronged
innocence
Unrevenged lie, whilst charity proclames it
lawful?
A crime unpunished is a virtue in the opinion
Of the giddy multitude.
Let not misconstruing fools contract
those beams
Which in a bounteous manner use to slow
Even to the period of their lustre.
No Mortals force procured my hate:
I still preserved thee like a blooming Rose,
VVater'd thee with my choicest streams, and
sand thee
With my pleasingest gales, till envious fate
Stole that delicious Bud, not fully ripened.
Thou had fore••all'd his office else;
and like
A treacherous wretch to make my ruin
seem more horrid,
When that my pampered Appetite lay
bathing in felicity
Thou would have thrown me headlong to destruction,
There to die like to some harmless Beast
Fatted for slaughter.
It was devotion sought thy ruin, I was compelled
To play the Tyrant by Religion: and like
A careful Mariner in a storm, to throw away
A Gem, p•is it far beyond my Diadem,
Witness ye Heavens how oft my Zeal
Suffered affections checks; how oft my Love
Held back my hand from ruining that come∣lie
Temple
Which I so admired, and ever must, though now
Imagination makes it horrid.
Play not still the Hypocrite;
Why mention'st Love? Did ever Love
Pronounce so sad a sentence.
Witness ye powers before whom I kneel
How dearly, dearly I did love thee; And
surely
Had not fate been so hasty, I had rug'd hard
With my Religion to have saved thee.
His own words condemn him▪
They do most mighty Prince, and
we obey.
Love that so long has bared me from my throne
Once more reseats me in my former dignity.
Seize on the Usurper Guard.
Hands off, Rebellious Miscreants,
that unjust authority
Profaneness our sacred person? Can Scicilians
Grow so impious, to violate their Kings?
The date of your supremacis is ex∣pir'd;
your approaching end
Must put a fatal period to your Tyranny:
A Crown
Is off too pure a mettle to endure long
Within so gross a Mine.
Unheard of wickedness! Heavens
can you hear this,
And dart no quick consuming plague into his
treacherous bosom:
Where be those Laws which we Scicilians still
Held as Religious orders? whore's Piety
And Allegiance, out adored Penates.
Here in this breast: Long has Religion
And my former vow maintained thy Tyranny:
Long have I seen thy pompous height
Grown riotous with my ruin, yet still have
flattered it
Without ambitious interruptions: No
High fuelled thought has once desired a re∣possession
Nor ever should, had not thy love of him
Declared a forfeture.
Take not so poor a Covert for thy irreligion:
A Boys chaste Love forfeits no Diadem.
Thus, that false title I renounce: thus
I appear my self, decked with my virgins inno∣cence;
These blushes speaks me woman Sir.
Am I outreached in policy? good Fate
Send some invisible dart, and kill me quickly,
Shame will deceive thee of thy triumph else.
Be not ashamed Bermudo: It is an
honour for to fall
Thrust by a Royal hand: A practised Poli∣titian
No ignoble brain did work thy ruin.
Our revenge must thank thee Thesbia;
Thou hast dissolved this mass of Tyranny,
And brought our long-lost honours to their
former lustre:
We owe duty to thee for our second birth,
And ignorance must pay ingratitude, if you
refuse
The reacceptance of that Crown bestowed so freely
By your Liberality. I will not say Vintusus
has desert
Whose just heat may challenge your affection,
That were to extol him beyond humane
merit,
But I dare say though poor in worth
Hoe's rich in his endeavours.
Her blushes do bewray her Love,
which long ete this
Had met its wished for happiness, Had not revenge
For my second Fidelio been too obstinate.
The love of him made her forgo her Coun∣try,
And on unknown Lands hazard these many dangers
In his search: She told it to me, when her
Confessor.
Here take her Virtusus as a Virgin Sacrifice,
Pure as the timely blossom whose forward
Zeal
Decks the arising Spring.
I'll make the harmony complete:
Thus from that cloister which my timorous
age
Before designed thee too, a parents care re∣leases
thee;
And with the same devotion confines thee to
Fidelio;
Turn thy Repentance to obedience, thy zeal to Love,
And all thy care into a settled constancy,
That from the ruins of that chaster Temple
A sacred Structure may erect it self, no less
perspicuous.
May our Kingdoms joined by this
double concord
Like two flames of incense shoot up still
In one continued lustre, whilst our souls
Peitcht on their sparing glories
Reach an immortality.
Can I yet live and see my life divided?
Shall Hymeneal flames consume her Virgin
Zone
And I stand by a vain Spectator: Patience
Thou art a virtue.
What sad thought great King can in
the midst
Of this solemnity draw such a veil ore that
majestic splendour?
Which in his perfect brightness ought to shine
To the refreshing of your numbed Subjects.
The remembrance of my lost Sister,
hangs like a dog
Upon my soul, yet prompts me forward to revenge.
Can Charastus triumph whilst Desdonella lies
In her eternal sleep, rocked with the pleasing
Lullaby
Of falling waters? Can I maintain a thought
Tending to happiness, before Revenge
Has quietly entombed her? first shall my rage
Swell higher than the streams that buried
her,
That all may perish with its inundation.
Rob not the Heavens Charastus of
the honour
Due for your happiness: can you be so in∣grateful
To their mercy, to let revenge
Cheat them of their alacrity climbed justly by
their •avors.
Stop not the current of his anger:
Let it flow.
Here are no trembling barks that fear its vi∣gore.
Could he invent a torment which never yet
His predecessors boasted of, my patience
Should convert it into charity.
Diana! amaze me not ye Heavens:
Can she vouchsafe such favour unto him
Who late abused her with immodesty? my
incredultty
Sins too much against her virtue: It is she,
The Air's perfumed, the odoriferous clouds
Filled with delicious spices distills to odors:
The fragrant flowers as she walks
Offers their sweetest incense, and where she
treads
The adoring grass bows in a pious gratitude.
Are ye all amazed? why kneel ye not,
And with a general adoration entertain that
Deity
That freely comes to visit you? Thus greatest Goddess
My obedient soul submits with truest peni∣tence,
I must confess I did abuse your presence
With most profane &amp; unchaste ceremonies,
Yet I must say it was my Zeal,
And the assurance of your clemency, that
made me.
Arise Bermudo: it is I must kneel;
Thus as a Subject to your power I bow,
But as a powerful Subject thus I stand.
If my supposed death has in your noble breast
Kindled religious sparks, if Desdonellas fare
Has moved your patience to Revenge,
Calm your disturbed thoughts; See I live
This shape is truly real.
My Sister Desdonella, more welcome
than my immortality:
Unto what power shall I ascribe this happi∣nos?
I owe my life unto his courtesy;
He mock't Bermud'os Statutes with my feign∣ed
death,
Whilst in a Cave my melancholy Lu•e and I
Flattered each others misery.
Surely Halisdus thou were born
To make thy King ungrateful; my joys
abound
To an unmeasured height, I fear they are
Too vehement to last.
I am amazed; my converted appetite
Courts an unknown desire; my fervent zeal
Turns to a looser flame, and worships now
The Temple for the Deity.
Why now so strange Bermudo?
did thou admire
The structure only for the builders sake?
Is it become less glorious in another right?
Can virtue vanish with a name.
No Desdonella thy supposed divinity
Made me perceive something that still is ex∣cellent;
All is not vanished with those beams,
The departed Sun leaves still a heat behind
him.
But can that heat, cast from those weaker rays
Extract so full an adoration? Can thou bu•
pay
A liking to its fervor, and not contemn it
For the absent Sun?
How impious were I should I hate
that shape
Which I durst think Diana would inhabit?
When I contemn it, may my blood forget its
motion,
My soul her faculties, and the Heavens my soul.
On that condition take thy throne
again.
Learn now to be a King, and rule with such
pleasing majesty
That thy Subjects may sooner doubt thy fa∣for,
Than fear thy anger.
This Council might be welcome
unto them
That do desire a Diadem; But unto him
That is already wearied with his weight,
It is as vain as expent fencing unto Cowards,
They may have skill, but dare not use it.
Yet, if you'll needs instruct my unwilling soul
In that virtue which you only Sir are Master
of,
Reign longer than, and let me learn by your
example.
He must not reign that cannot rule Affection;
If you refuse this favour, I shall suspect you
Still to be a Tyrant, and nor worthy of my
Sister.
Alas what means my Brother?
To make thee Queen, and •eat thee
In the highest dignity, whilst • in Shepherds
weeds
Learn to assuage desires. Nay weep not
sweet Flavanda,
Perhaps thou dost suspect thou art a stranger
to my heart,
But witness, oh ye Heavens, that what I do
Proceeds from Love to thee; Thee I will
meditate,
And when I sleep my dreams shall fancy thee.
Still I'll discos of thee, and when the happy
end
Has crowned my studies that I truly know thee,
I shall have searched the deepest point of all
Philosophy.
But you fair Princess whose conquering eye
Has took a prisoner captive, and now boasts
In the bare spoil of another victory,
You I must ne'er remember, but must
As ill taught children learn to forget again
What my greedy eye too soon conceived.
Good Sir.
Make not me an accessory to your inconstan∣cy.
Your hopes of me you see are vain,
Hymen has joined our hearts already in a
knot
Which nought can separate but death.
Tic true, fair Creature, you are His:
Meet him with an ardent Love.
And from the Ashes of thy nicer cha••tie
Let a tall Phoenix issue, whilst I
In silent groves desire of Fate to dye.
Stay Charastus; Let not thy destruction
Crown our wedding.
Let fortune then decide the co••to∣verse:
Here
Take this sword, and plead thy title, a cause
so just
Would make a Coward valiant:
But me a Coward.
Thy goodness has incen'st me;
Dost thou refuse the combat? take •eed
Pull not a ruin on thee with thy virtue; I
am enraged.
My envious heart is tympaniz'd with anger.
Had thou but offered to have fought at first,
I then had left the combat, and with as much
scorn
Had hated thy disloyalty, as now I emulate
thy goodness.
Guard thy self.
Hold, Princes hold, Make not a
Theater of the Temple:
Do not profane this sacred place
With an incestuous quarrel.
Incestuous? Is love incestuous?
Yes, of your sister.
I have no sister except Desdonella.
Pardon me great King if I unfold a
secret.
Which never should have been revealed
Had not the fear of your destruction forced
me.
If it be good, do not delay my joys so long
As I shall be in pardning thee.
You greatest Princess, I have injured
most,
But yet I know your virtues to be such
That I despair not of a Pardon.
Assure thy self there is no crime so
horrid
But the remembrance of thy former goodness
Will command a Pardon for.
Then thus Braba•tas I restore thy
Son
Took from thee in the late intestine wars
When Scicilies three Monarchs like three
meeting streams
Strove to convert each others Kingdom
To their own Dominions.
I must confess in those inhumane
broils
When Scicily groaned with her civil wars,
I lost a Son
Who in his tender years was taken from his Nurse
By the rough violence of a barbarous soldier.
I was that soldier that in hope of
great reward
Took from the nurse that unresisting Babe
And brought him here to Lelybaevs to present
The King with: But fortune, that seldom
Crosses wicked men, then •rown'd on me:
For our tender Prince committed for the
more security
To my loving wife, did with a fall
From her too careless arms receive his death.
Oh most unhappy fate.
I then was forced to turn my captive
to a Prince again,
For in the room of dead Charastus
I then placed your Son, who hitherto
Has lived our Sovereign, and ever should, Had
not
The fear of their approaching ruins told it.
This happiness may be wished for,
not obtained.
I could produce your Kingdoms
Arms
Wove on his Mantle, but this would be
A shallow testimony to that I'll show you.
Look on his left wrist, there you may see
The half Moon, from which Lunaster he was
named
If Fems Report be true.
It is most true; He had his name
from then•e.
See Royal Sir, it is still preserved.
Do I yet live, and see my Son Lu∣naster?
Fate thou art too bounteous: I cannot live
To pay a due gratuity, an age will be too lit∣tle
To express my joys in.
Am I deceased that now my transmi∣grated
soul
Seeks out a new inolosure?
Tell me my name good Heavens, my Coun∣trey
too,
Who are my Kin, or rather who are not.
All here I think do claim alliance.
Fairest Constantine my divining soul
Prompts me to call thee Sister: Be not I
prithee
Angry with my Love, I will no more
Harbour ince••uous flames, yet I will see thee
still,
And keep a Brothers distance: you'll not be
jealous Sir?
I were injurious to her virtue then.
Nor you Flavanda?
Let me dye hated first of all,
And have no tomb but malice.
I am not mortal sure, such joys
as these
Belong to immortality.
When three Kingdoms join, it is
a Royal unity,
Scicily shall be no more Trinacria now
But one promontory whose soaring top
Stretched hove the insulting billows
Shall strike a terror to our foes, whilst we
Armed with their fear sleep in security▪
Let not the loss dear Brother
Of this Kingdom trouble you; we'll haste
unto Pachynus
And when that envious •ate bereaves us of
our father,
Thou and I, will like the Zodiacs Gemini,
Reign our alternate courses in that happy
Kingdom.
Yet I must ruinate that happiness:
It is I Virtusus that must disinthrone thee.
So Apollo said.
No dearest Sister, I am
That Brother that Apollo meant; my crown
Already thou hast lost, my Love to thee has
lost it.
Ha•st thou been less fair, less constant to Fi∣leo,
And more kind to me, I still had reigned;
This ne'er had been divulged; Had it Ha∣lisdus?
Never Sir. Tortures should ne'er
have forced it
From me.
The Oracle is fulfilled then. Let all
fears vanish.
Heavens knew a Crown was not my due,
That made me sure so willing for to part
with it.
I am glad tic gon so fairly, and I am confi∣dent
There's none, knew he the cares, the troubles,
The perplexed thoughts and dangers that
attends
A good Kings throne, but he would resign
As willingly as I do, did not his calling,
And his shame forbid it. That Kingdom
Which my ignorance so long usurped, returns
to thee Bermudo,
It is Desdonella's right, she is the richer
Jewel.
Be once a man again, and from the ruins
Of thy pristine Tyranny, build a most glo∣rios
Structure
To reach Heaven; Let not thy former crew∣elty
Make thee despair; who would aspire
Ought first to fall, that he may rise the
higher.
Come dearest Desdonella, too long
I have practised Tyranny;
Mercy hereafter shall become my study. For
now I see
Our lives are but a Scene, a Scene that
changes
At the will and pleasure of the Author;
We are all but Actors and do take
Each several day a several part; This day
We personate a King, the next a Beggar.
This is our course of life which varies still,
till Death
The closer up of all comes in and clean
Puts out the Tapers, and withdraws the
Scene.

Comodus, What eye did ere till now behold
Folly and madness acted to the life?
I wonder Formidon, the King could bear
Such saucy passion with so clear a brow.
His wisdom knew that Pertenax was far
Too mean a subject for his discontent.
And rather looked upon his crack-brain'd words
With princely eyes of pity then revenge.
Such frantic terms without the privilege
Of fool or mad-man would have easily raised
Billows of fury in the calmest breast,
And heaved a wel-hang'd patience off her hinge.
Nay, to be basely rude in such a place,
Artesio's house, whose roof the King was pleased
To honour with his presence—
Nay worse, at such a time when he was pleased to lend
Free reins to mirth, and to suspend those cares
That claim such interest in the Imperial brow.
Nay, when his fair acceptance crowned the Feast
Of glad Artesio, with his princely thanks;
Nay, when his royal hand had newly laid
The Sword upon his shoulders, and received him
Into the glorious Order of a Knight,
Then to break out into such baseness thus—
What moved him to it?
Nay, he were wise could tell:
I saw no cause at all
Unless it were
Some jealous qualm arising from a kiss
Too hardly printed on Kettreena's lip
By way of welcome to her Ladyship.
That might well be, for it was no sooner done
But he (not far to seek for passion
Or terms to vent it) brake into this fury,
And being choked with choler left the room:
Whereat his new-made Lady pale as death
(No stranger to his passion) winck'd me out
To follow him.
I marked that passage well,
And reading the dumb message in her eye
Writ in pale characters, I quit the room
To feel his pulse; whom if I chance to spy
Isle read a lecture to him:
So will I.
Were he as many Kings as he has Subjects to a∣buse,
I'd not endure 't. Come, the plain truth is, I
don't like it, so I don't, nor should I spare him had he
been a King of Gold: What? should I stood like a fool
to be his shooing-horne to draw a pair of horns upon
my head, and turn Pander to his lickerish kisses, while he
wipes my mouth with a cod-piece Knighthood? I'll
hang first. Let him bestow his honour with a vengeance
upon those that hold it a good pen'worth on such
terms: For my part I like it not. Have I lived these
thrice thirty years, to be caught with Chafe? Kettreena
must be a Lady forsooth, to be more capable of his
princely lust. And Pertenax must be dubbed, and gain
the glorious attribute of a right worshipful Cuckold.
Come, these are baits to catch young birds with, and
honourable mists to blind ambitious fools with. His
politic Majesty has taken a wrong Sow by th'eare.
I'm none of those that for a smile can play the royal
Pander, nor like a temporising Whittled can help my
wanton Prince into the Saddle, or hold his Stirrup. Did
I not mark the lustful progress of his lascivious glaun∣ces?
And how his ugly rolling eyes shot fire-brands at
Kettreena's face? How every word was garnished with
a wanton smile, and still presented to Kettreena's ear!
His antic gestures, crotches, congees, cringes, comple∣mints,
and all directed to Kettreena! While she like a
wel-disciplin'd Courtesan could counterfeit a modesty,
against her conscience, to whet his lust into an appetite;
and like a coy dissembling Bride, could sit and mince it,
and inwardly rejoice to think of future times.—But
see they come; I'll stand aside and watch.
Artesio, we shall study to requite
Thy bounteous entertainment, and whilst we
Possess th'Imperiall Crown, be confident
Thou hast a friend at Court. Come Kettreena,
Cheer up: W'are pleased to set thy Husbands rudeness
Upon the score of Age the Advocate
Of all infirmity.
Most gracious Prince,
The strength of your known wisdom does appear
More eminent in his weakness.
A courtly Whore!
And his extreme defects
Are by your goodness graciously supplied.
An ignominious Whore!
For which Kettreena,
As duty binds, shall with a grateful heart
Lie prostrate at your feet.
A prostrate Whore!
And always active to discharge that score
Of your high favours.
Hey! an active Whore!
Enough Kettreena; thy fair merits give
Breath to our favours, and make virtue live.
I, let them go: Sister, we are too course
For their respects.
Methinks we merely serve
Like worthless Ciphers to increase a number.
Or like odd money in a Taylors Bill
Only to be abated: Let them go.
But yet methinks it is odd, that all the Trumps
Should lie in fair Kettreena's hand, and none
In ours.
Come, kissing goes by favour; Let her go
With her fair Game.
But that which vexed me most,
The foolish King had nothing else to say
But I was like my Father, when he knows
Comparisons are odious.
Nay worse,
His Complement to me was this, That I
Bore my years well; As good h'ad called me old,
A word far more injurious then Whore.
Bear my years well? What is there in this face
To merit such a Complement?
I like my Father? though I say it,
I scorn't:
My brow's not wrinkled.
These my Fathers eyes?
My teeth all sound.
My Fathers lips like these?
Cheeks plump enough.
Is this my Fathers hair?
Eyes quick and clear.
Was h'ever half so fair?
A double chin! What Symptons can he gather
Of Age?
Or what resemblance of my Father?
What secret beauty lurks there in Kettreena
That is ecclip'd in Rosie?
Or Marina?
True, She's snout fair; yet by her favour I
Would scarce turn tables with her, though I say it.
She has a courtly tongue, to breed delight.
She has a Husband too; that is a Knight.
Had he not been the King, he should have known
That I was sensible of his affront.
King, or no King, my ready fingers itched
To scratch revenge on's face: I like my Father!
And yet our valiant Husbands could stand by
And hear all this, and yet make no reply.
When Pertenax impatient of disgrace
Could nose the King, and beard him to his face.
Husbands! Husbands of Clouts.
But, as for mine,
I'll ring his ears a peal of discipline:
I'll act my part; and if Marina fails,
Let me want fingers, or these fingers nails.
Then let everlasting health be entailed upon the
sons of men, and let the curse of a strong constitution fall
upon man-kind, if I dis-card thee not: Away, avoid my
sight; must I thus squander out my precious hours,
and wast my wakeful night, to turn Baud to a hundred
Marks, and connive at these your avaricious Murders?
Away, thine eyes are Basilisks, and dart venom at me
too strong for Antidotes to resist.
'T was but once or twice six months, good
Doctor be appeased.
Appeased! My fury hath no ears; my boiling
gall breathes up such fumes of bitterness into my crazy
brains, that there is left no place for patience to repose.
I thought so faithful a servant as I might have
deserved one life among so many Patients, to put me in∣to
a new Suit of apparel, against Easter, without so much
ado.
Slave! shall you be first served or I? who gave
you leave to send my Patients to the shades of death
without my licence! How durst you be so bold to
snatch my wel-dealt Cards out of my skilful hand,
whilst I was studious to contrive and make the best ad∣vantage
to my self?
He could not by nature have lived much lone∣ger,
Sir, I did but save neighbouring death a labour.
What tell thou me of nature? Is not the Pa∣tent
mine? Have not I power to produce the twine of
frail mortality, in spite of death, or nature? Cannot
I lengthen out the groaning days of transitory flesh, or
cut them short according to my pleasure and advan∣tage?
Good Sir, All this I know.
Why, varlot, then durst you presume to stop
the gainful practises which I intended? When as the
sapless Stock could thrust no further Branches forth,
worthy our notice, you might have then by permission,
done your will upon him for your best advantage:
When we had taken the first crop of his exuberous bags,
you might have then made bold to eat the Rowens;
Till then your insolence exceeded our Commission.
Had he been born to swim against the stream of fortune,
or tortured in the stubborn schools of daring Resolute∣on:
Or had his hide-bound purse preferred his sacred
wealth before the lingering hopes of costly health—
But thus, to ravish from our thriving hand a man of
Fortunes, one that desired to take up life at Interest, nay
to buy his languishment at so profuse a Rate, denies all
thought of Patience. Away, Avaunt, begone,
No more Artesio's Servant now.
Bad be those Drivers that unhorse the Plough.
Is it even so? Quack's thread is fairly spun,
Quack may go home again, his market's done.
Is there never a Statute throughout the Volumes
of the Law, that tolerates a man to hang himself?
If there were, it was repealed in the next King's
Reign, for a great inconvenience that grew upon it.
The more's the pity: To my thinking it were
a very fine harmless exercise.
Why? there's a custom for it, for those that
will seek the Rolls, and have such Wives as I with Cor∣nelius
his motion in her mouth.
Come, you are happy, the disease lies at that
end; I would my Baggage would speak till her heart
ache so she did less.
Fie Pertenax, wrong not sweet innocence so
much. Had but the Stars been pleased, would our Wives
had been like our Indentures made interchangeable:
Comodus and I picked out both the vices, and left the
virtue for you. Never could any but Artesio that by art
can alter his constitution as he lists, been Father to three
such different Daughters. Marma vents her spirit by the
Nails, my Rosie, hers by Tongue; and Kettreena hers
by Tears: which like fluent Orators, plead a soft heart,
a sweet nature, and a high spirit qualified with a mild
discretion, and a harsh Husband.
Every one knows best where his shoe wrings
him: She's mild enough, and that the King knows, I
fear to my cost.
And though I say it before thy face, she's fitter
for a King then such a testy fool. But who comes here?
Comodus?
Comodus with a night-cap, and a scratched face.
From Harpies nails, from Furies whips,
From all sharp noses, and thin lips;
From two-legged Cats with thrice nine lives,
From scalding woort, from scolding Wives,
From ful-mouth'd blasts, from female blows,
From smooth-fac'd Sluts, from sharp-nail'd
Shrowes;
From wounds t'inflict, from plagues t'inflict
me,
My Genius bless, my Stars protect me.
Now Comodus, what means this desperation?
What Fury has possessed thee? What strange fit
Usurps thy patience, and beclouds thy brow?
What means this strange Militia in thine eyes?
Who raised this storm? Has Age or Wedlock lent thee
This sickly Night-cap? Tell us what's the cause
Of this dull change?
I have a Reason for'〈…〉
I fear, I fear, some Oeconomick fire
Hath late been kindled: Tell us what's the cause
Of these sad looks?
I have a Reason for it.
Disclose it then: Come, if the Bile be ripe
It is best to lance it: A revealed grief
Invites to cure, lies open to relief.
He that can still the Thunder, or assuage
The flames of sulphrous Aetna, or command
The hideous powers of infernal Spirits
Resolve for vengeance, he, and only he
Can cure my grief: Marinas louder tongue
Out-rores the Thunder, and her flaming eyes
Out-scorches Aetna: Her impetuous rage
Out-devils the whole Academy of Hell.
Blows the wind there away?
What ails thy face?
It was lately harrowed with her Harpy nails.
Why did not pare them then?
Why did not stop her viperous mouth?
Why did not drive those troops of Devils
From her stormy tongue?
Bid me go snatch a daring Thunder-bolt,
Or twi-forkt lightning from the hand of Jove:
Bid me go stop the flowing Tides, or stay
A singing Bullet in her middle way:
Bid me go tame a Dragon; or restrain
The Arms of Furies bent to high revenge,
This were an easy task; nay, easier far
To slack Hells flames, then quench Marina's rage.
Nay, then thy case is desperate, farewell.
Who finds a Shrew, need fear no other Hell.
Such Devils 〈◊〉 be tamed; But when the Ram
Begins to butt, ô there's both Devil, and Dam.
But Trippit is this certain?
Yes as sure
Madam, as fame can make it: It is the voice
Of the whole Court, whispered from ear to ear.
Madam, let not your easy faith rely
Too much upon the voice of babbling fame;
The Court is grown so vain, that it beholds
All in extremes, and in owns nothing good
But what it censures evil.
There's no smoke
Without some fire: Report must have some ground.
Nay Madam, it is gone so far, that they
Stick not to stile her by the name of Queen.
That's far enough a conscience, but I hope
The fair Kettreena will be pleased to stay
Till we resign, ordie.
Madam, believe it not,
The Court is too censorious, and will tax
The innocence of a very smile:
They weigh our reputations with the scales
Of their own loose conceits, and our good Names,
Though ne'er so fair, must be allowed by them,
Or given for light.
But is she stiled Queen?
Yes, by that frantic fool, old Pertenax
Her jealous Husband, whose malignant eye
Reads rank Adultery in a harmless smile,
And construes friendly mirth, and fair deportment
No less then Whoredom, and a crime that's fit
To suffer an Aspect more grim then death.
Such looks as his are sour enough to fright
Diana from her chastity: And who
Ere canonised Kettreena for a Saint?
Or took the King for more then flesh and blood?
There's something in the wind, that here of late
The King is more estranged in his behaviour
Then he was wont; His language more reserved;
His thoughts so various, that an easy eye
May read some alteration in his breast,
I fear, I'm wronged.
Madam, let not such thoughts
Possess your fancy, or disturb your peace:
Evaldus is a Prince too noble, and too just
To be surprised by any eyes, but yours,
The only stars whereby his fortunes fail.
But has he Knighted Pertenax?
Yes Madam,
And whispering joy in his new Ladies ear,
He feal'd it with a kiss, which Pertenax
Could not digest, but straight brake out in flames
At old Artesio's House, where he was late
Received as a self-invited Guest.
It was kindly done: Evaldus has his end;
Fire will want heat when beauty lacks a friend.
Let's hear no more on it.
Come, sheath up your swords,
And as ye love my quiet and your own,
Let's hear no more on it. What? have I three sons,
And ne'er a wife one? Ye are both too blame
To raise such Tumults, and to sow these seeds
Of factious discords in our settled State.
Away! Each one to his Command: For you
Bellario, and Palladius, we shall find
A speedy way to let you understand
Whose is the Birth-right; and since the pleased Fates
Have made so little difference betwixt you
By your twin-birth, in your Aspects and marks
Doe you the like in your united hearts
Till time and our best care shall bring to light
Our true Successor in our doubtful throne
Stand both contented, And let your contentions
Find out no object, but obedience.
And you Mucous, whose unrivalled thoughts
Have pitched their Territories, far more safe
Where you enjoy more happiness, more rest
Then he that wept for want of Worlds to win,
Whose boundless limits, and more vast confines
Extend from the Arctic to the Antarctic Pole,
And in the Closet of thy Contemplation,
Can sit and blow new Worlds like bubbles; then
Demolish and dissolve them at thy pleasure,
Advise thy factious Brothers: Let them know
That Birth-right which they strive for can but make
A king at best, and fill their Arms with Ayre;
Their Lives with dangers, and their Crown with care.
Sir,
I'll doe my best to advise.
And we to obey.
Crowns are too great,
For breath to blow away.
Artesio, say, what discontents have raised
These clouds, that over-cast thy cheerful brow,
And make sad weather in Kettreena's face?
My age, most gracious Sovereign can expect
Small sun-shine in this world: My wasted years
Find little relish in these worldly toys.
Cheer up Artesio, If our favours can
Quicken thy joys, and make thy times more sweet
Thou shalt not want them; We shall bend our care
For thy advancement, and thy Childrens good.
But say, Artesio, what disastrous evil
Hath stamped thy looks with these late sad impressions?
Kettreena, tell me, for thine eye appears
An equal sharer in his silent tears?
Most ex'lent Prince, my Fathers tender care
And dear affection, looking on my merits
With multiplying Glasses, and conceiving
All happiness too little for my heart,
Thinks (though perchance without just ground) that I
Receive not those sweet comforts, that should spring
From the blessed bounty of conjugal love:
But I less conscious of my own deserts.
Complain not of my fortunes; but joy, rather
To find the sweet indulgence of a Father.
O that these cursed fingers had been struck
With a dead Palsy when I tied that knot,
And these gold-blinded eyes when they surveyed
His vast possessions, had been stricken blind:
Poor Girl!
But how can Pertenax devise
To wrong such patience? On what just ground
Can he pretend to build the least distaste?
Upon her noted virtue, by which light
His ugly vices doe appear more bright.
Which then reflecting on his conscious soul
Affrights him into madness, who, enraged
Flies in the very face of all desert.
Well, good Artesio, what's not past our help
Shall be redressed, We will paliate the disease
We cannot cure, and with our favours strive
To hide the wrinkles of cursed Fortunes brow.
In which respects, Artesio, we are pleased
To make thee our chief Doctor to attend
On our own person; likewise for the trust
Reposed in thy fidelity, we make,
And choose thee here a Counsellour of State.
Thee Formidon for thy sweet Rosias sake
Artesio's Daughter, we appoint and choose
Attourney-Generall for our Royal Causes:
Thee Comodus the Master of our Mint.
Long live Evaldus our most gracious Lord
And Master.
Go Mucous, see them sworn.
Kettreena, stay, we have a word to exchange:
Sit down Kettreena: Here's an empty Chair
Invites thy presence; Come, why come thou not?
Most gracious Sovereign, That's a seat not fit
For Subjects; Sir, be pleased to lay commands
My duty may not blush to-execute.
Lay by your Complements, Kettreena, Come
Repose by us; We will warrant our Commands.
Excuse me Sir, and let this bended knee
(A posture far more fit) attend your pleasure.
Nay, rise Kettreena: Something tells my heart
Thou art too blame: Sit here;
We will have it so.
So, now Kettreena, time and place conspire
To give advantage to my long desire.
Shall I not seem too curious to propound
A harmless question, to thy private ear?
In confidence, your grace will not command
Beyond my power and honour, I obey.
Then tell me sweet Kettreena, and tell true,
Had peevish Pertenax the maiden-head
Of thy Affection; did thy heart ne'er flame
Until his amorous Bellows blue the fire?
Sir, were it not too high presumption to enquire
The cause of your Command—
Nay, blush not Lady. It is nor sin nor shame
To tell the secrets of so sweet a flame.
That blush has half resolved me; what remains
To clear my doubt, let thy fair words produce.
Sir, were it a Sin, my Sin would not despair
That have my Sovereign to my Confessor:
Sir, I was ne'er so wise above my Sex
To blast Affections blossom in her spring,
Nor yet so nicely foolish to deny
That passion which has conquered more then I.
Lived there a Soul subjected to our Crown,
So blessed in his deservings, as to find
So great a favour at Kettreenas eyes?
Sir, may your Subjects flourish with desert
To merit such a Prince, but—
But? but what? Speak on Kettreena.
Let your Grace
Excuse my blunt abruption.
Come, speak out,
Thy full perfection can no way admit
Imperfect languages. Say on; but what?
But, it was no subject, gracious Prince of yours
That first enthralled my heart.
What was he then?
Was he some foreign Prince in a disguise
That came to rob our land of such a prize?
Tell me Ketreena, if thou dare repose
So great a secret in Evaldus breast.
What was he for a man? Of what condition?
From whence? What were his fortunes? his Allies?
Most gracious Sovereign, what, or whence he was
I cannot well relate: So many years
Have passed since then, that my remembrance may
Well plead her frailty: Whatsoere he was,
A Pilgrims weed eclipsed him.
Could thy heart make a sad Pilgrim
The object of thy love?
Sir, I was then but young, and my affection
Could find no Tutor but her own desires
Which curbed my nonag'd reason, with a hand
Too too severe for council to withstand.
I wonder how a Pilgrim durst attempt
So strong a task! upon what hopeful grounds
Could he presume to build his vain desire?
The ground of Love is love: And the direction
Which mere affection takes, is mere affection.
How long Kettreena since thy soft desire
Relented first at thy bold Pilgrims fire?
Fates bless the token: Even that very year
Your highness first set happy footing here
To tie that blessed, that royal knot between
Your sacred self, and our as sacred Queen.
But did that Pilgrim never since appear
Discovered to thine eye?
Great Sir, mine ear
Was never since made happy with the news
That he is living, for whose sake I wear
These weeds of mourning: True, the great desire
Of my well-being urged my Fathers heart
To match me to a wealthy discontent,
But my Obedience thwarted my Affection,
And made me prisoner to a secret vow,
Which I have kept as spotless as my name.
Has not thy Mariage-bed dissolved that vow.
Although I live sad Pertenax his Wife,
Yet shall I prove his Virgin when I die.
Tell me Kettreena, dost thou know this Ring?
Why dost thou start Kettreena? Dost thou know it?
What means these tears?
What means this change of weather?
Tell me, Kettreena, dost thou know this Ring?
Sir, too too well, And in this Ring I read
The secret story of my Pilgrims death:
Heavens rest and all my joys be with him; Sir,
He was too good to live, and wretched I
A slave to life, not good enough to die.
Come, come, Kettreena, let those precious drops
Forbear to trickle: Come, thy Pilgrim lives
And fares no worse then I: I am the man.
Abuse me not great Prince: O punish not
My rude (but yet obedient) boldness thus:
Deride not her whom fortune hath depressed,
And hath a loyal, though a troubled breast.
It is I that was that Pilgrim, and disguised
Wandered this land (whose Crown I was fore-told
By our Chaldean Prophet should be set
Upon my Temples) and directed to
Artesio's house; I found that very face
His Glass presented to my wandering eyes
In viewing thee, whom he mistook as Queen,
And read my Regal fortunes in thy love;
Adding this prophecy, as yet untold,
She that gives thee the first Ring
Shall crown thy head, and make thee King.
This is that Ring, which given thou drop'dst a tear,
And whispered'st thus: This Ring is Cupped s Sphere.
It was I, to whose safe trust thou did repose
A secret, which this tongue shall ne'er disclose;
These were the lips which gave thee that advise,
My judgment thought most fit, and thine approved.
I am convinced dread Sovereign, and amazed,
My trembling heart's surprised twixt joy and fear.
Fear not Kettreena, I am still the same,
And so art thou, excepting this alone:
Thou found a Croffe, and I have gained a Crown,
Which I'll renounce, and call no longer mine
When it shall cease to advance both thee and thine:
And for a Pledge, we tender on our part
Our royal hand; with it a real heart.
Your hand's enough great Prince; as for the rest
I'm not ambitious now.
Be not deceived
My sweet Kettreena, there's no dregs of lust
Defiles that bosom thou so fear to trust:
It is fair and spotless, and contrives no end
But what may merit so divine a friend.
I question not; And for that heart, return
A heart (though far unequal, yet) shall burn
With equal fires.
And let Kettreena know
Nor time, nor fortunes shall have power to show
The shadow of a change: And mark how long
Times hower-glasse shall measure out my days.
Till then—
But hold! The Queen prevents the rest.
How now my dear Augusta? Art thou come
To give's a visit? Love, it is kindly done.
I fear my Lord the King, my blunt access
Hath given the privacies of your discourse
Too quick a period.
No, no my dear,
At thy approach, all business does appear
Like pale-fac'd stars before the rising Sun.
Madam Kettreena, I must give you joy.
Me joy, most excellent Princess!
Pray, for what?
Nay, never blush: I say, I wish you joy.
I thank your Grace, Be pleased to say, wherein.
Of your new Ladyship: Come, now you know.
What ails my Lord the King? Are you not well?
Why? dear Augusta.
Cause ye look so pale,
Your colour's gone into Kettreenas cheeks;
But are you well indeed? I wish you joy, too.
Thanks sweet Augusta: Tell me dear of what?
Of your new Servants that you made to day.
But I transgress: My Lord, the King, Farewell.
What haste Augusta? We will together hence.
Madam Kettreena—
Lord! what means your Grace?
Excuse me Madam—pray—
Your Highness now
Make me ridiculous.
You'll wrong your self—

A pretty Reck'ning!
As I am a virtuous Apothecary, I know not how to sub∣sist.
Here's all that's coming to me, and that's not to
be expected till Christmas, if paid then. Gentlemen, I
am in a very skirvy case. Artesio has turned me out of
his service, and I must break. What shall I doe? I must
play the good Fellow abroad, and then my Wife plays
the Devil at home. How can the one be maintained?
or the other endured? I have pawned already her
Tuftaffaty Petticoat and all her Child-bed linen, be∣sides
two tiffiny Aprons, and her bearing-cloth, for
which I have had already two curtame Lectures, and a
black and blue eye. But stay! my satin Doublet had
yet a good gloss, and her silk mohair Petticoat and
Wastcote will make a good show in a Country Church.
Nay, my credit will yet pass in Bucklers berry for
five pounds worth of Commodity, which with the help
of a gold Night-cap, a few conjuring words and a large
conscience will go far, and set me up in a Market town,
where I may pass for a Padua Doctor: It is but Italia∣nating
my name, garb, language, and habit, and then
Seignior Quackquinto may practice as safely, kill as eg∣norantly
and innocently as Artesio himself, or any
Doctor in the King's Dominions. And when my Name
is once but raised upon the wings of popularity, the bet∣la
sort will hold it disparagement to their judgments
not to magnify Quackquinto, and rather not be sick at
all, then to be counselled by Quackquinto; Every disease
will call upon Quackquinto. If any foolish Lord be sick
of a Pleurisy of Gold, who must be sent for but the Ita∣lian
Doctor, Seignior Quackquinto? If any love-sick
Lady would take a Pill to purge melancholy, who must
be sought to but the Italian Doctor, Seignior Quack∣quinto?
And then so honourable will the Name of the
Italian Doctor be, that he's not fashionably sick that
will not advise with Seignior Quackquinto. But the way
to proceed is not to stay here.
So,
Let their ambitions clime and shake the tree,
When the fruit falls 't may chance to fall to me:
I'll stand below and watch; They seldom fall
That keep their Stations, and not clime at all:
Low fortunes find most rest, abide most sure,
When lofty Cedars shake, Shrubs stand secure:
Bellarmo will be Prince: Palladius, he
Assumes the self-same Title: Both will be
Evaldus Heirs, both Kings; both jointly scorn
The stile of Subject: Both will be first-borne:
I, let them jar; And let the golden Apple
Remain still doubtful; Let them grasp and grapple:
Mucous, stand thou Neuter: Oft it is known,
When two Dogs fight, the third does catch the bone.
Had I imagined Kettreenas Ladyship had been no
worse, I should have made bold to owe her this visit a
day longer.
For any thing I see, she may live till all her friends
be weary of her. Quisquilla, what brought thee thither?
Did her Ladyship send for thee to watch?
Truly, I heard she was very ill, and when I
came, I found her very ill.
Some Qualm! May be she's breeding of a young
Prince.
Or sick of an old Knight: Methought she looked
very peevishly: If he'd but drop out of the way a little,
she'd be well enough.
Nay, indeed, they say, if Ladies, be not (as it
were) sick once a fortnight, they forfeit their Honour.
Why, then Quisquilla, thou thinks she's but a
little sick of course.
In truth then, our visit is suitable to her disease.
For my part, if her Ladyship had been sick to the
heart I should ha visited her with a better heart; But
sirrah, I believe our welcome was as hearty as our visit.
Truly, I believe you had been more welcome,
if you had staid two minutes longer.
Prithee, why Sirrah?
Nothing, but only her Maid could not find the
perfuming Pan, to take away the smell of the—
Of the what? Prithee Quis. what was the matter?
I know by thy simpering, thou hast some Roguery at thy
tongues end.
Prithee Quis. out with it.
Shall I? but as I live, ye must say nothing.
When she first heard of your coming, her Ladyship was
heartily tugging a piece of sod Bacon, and fearing ye
would come up a little too soon, as in truth ye did, her
Maid for haste hiding it under the bed, it slipped into the
chamber-pot.
The best that ever I heard,
She should ha thrown a few oynions after't, and stewed it
for the old Knight,
'T had been good enough for such an old mi∣serable
hound, to allow a sick Lady so course a diet.
Sirah, we have Husbands bad enough, but not
so bad.
Gramercy good Wives, that won't be such fools
to endure it. Quisquilla, I think thy Husband is no Saint
neither. Is he?
Yes, of the Devils canonising, Would I had
been hanged the first hour he saw me.
Why? what's the matter, Quis?
What? All that he gets he spends, and all he
can find he pawns: Yesterday, he broke open my chest
and pawned all my child-bed linen, and to day my Taf∣fatty
petticoat, and my best purld Gorget, and to make
up the matter, he hath plaid such pranks that the Doctor
has turned him out of his service.
Why dost not discipline him?
Discipline him? If I counsel him, he stands
like an Ass and casts up his ugly gray eyes: If I ring
him a peal he slights me with his silence, and that which
vexes me to the heart, stands and whistles. But if I live
till to morrow, for I know he'll come in drunk to night,
I'll whistle him, y'faith I will; I'll make him know what
it is to whistle a Wife, the longest hour he has to live,
y'faith I will.
A G•rle worth Gold.
Come, lead away, let's go.
She's a mere fool, that sometimes is no Shrove.
As I live and hope to be a Doctor, it was for
nothing in the universal world but for killing a rich Pa∣tient
of his a little before his time.
That was a poor thing to turn away an old Ser∣vant
for, especially a man of your profession.
It was nothing else as I am virtuous. Nay
more, He was a slow Pay-master too, and took Physic
upon the Ticket. Ah Madam, had he connived a little,
I had clearly gained a hundred Marks by his death.
How?
His younger Brother, a fine Gentleman, laid
me a hundred Marks he would live till our Lady-day.
Alas! I did no more for a considerable sum then my
Doctor has done a hundred times for nothing; I'm sure
I have been a gainful Servant to him, and that he knows
right well. But the truth is, he has no more conscience
with him then the dog has: How often have I left out
the chief Ingredient out of his Receipts to prolong the
Cure for his profit? How often dropped in a Dram of a
malignant quality into his Dose to make a Cure for
his gain! Nay, as I am an honest man, out of my rank
affection to him, at my own cost and charges kept a
brace of hot Creatures in Ordinary to help young Gentle∣men
to their Diseases for his sweet sake: Had I been a
knave, his Daughters had wanted many a satin Petti∣cote.
And thus my honest dealing is requited: But it is
no matter, There's more ways to the wood then one.
I have corruption enough in me to make a Country
Doctor. And it is no new thing to build up a new Phisi∣teen
upon the ruins of an old broken Apothecary.
Quack, you have a voluble tongue, and can ea∣sly
work upon the ignorant multitude, I could rather
wish you to turn Mountebank, What think thou of
that Quack?
Madam, I doubt not but I could cheat the
King's liege people as plausibly as another, if the King,
or any of his mad Sons would give me a License.
As for the King, Artesio is in too great favour
with him. But Prince Bellarmo will do it if you make the
means.
Your Ladyships word in my behalf will soon
be heard, for which, I shall present you with a New∣years-gift
a hundred Marks thick.
I'll move his Highness in it. Go get a License
drawn for him to sign.
I humbly thank your Ladyship.
So they are fat enough, And there let 'em starve and rot,
and let their Children pick their bones. I'll not abate
one single penny. Tell me of mercy? If their Wives
breasts want milk, let their Children suck blood. Their
Bonds are forfeit, and I'll have every farthing ere they
quit those Grates. Hoe, there within, Hoe, Kettreena.
Sir, did you call?
O are ye come, Hussif, go fetch my Box of Obe∣legations
down, Make haste, away. 
Compound quoth her, I'll no compounding, Though
they are beggars, they have able friends. I wonder ther's
no Statute to brand all Bankrupts in the forehead with a
hot iron, that men may know 'em. Nature had been
very provident if she had ordained that their flesh might
have risen and fallen with their fortunes, that we Money∣masters
might have traded without broken slumbers,
and have known a Rascal from a fat Dear.
O are ye come, give me, give me, quickly, quickly?
O that his virtues were enclosed there,
And that his honour were but half so dear!
Iohn Havelands Bond. 300l to pay 150 the
sixth of June next: Good.
What's here? Henry Thrift, 400l to pay 200 the 23 of
March next: and Good.
Humphrey Rich his bond to pay the double Interest of
500l for 10 years, and lose the principal: Good.
Quack's Bill of Sale of a Tuftaffaty Petticoat, and a chest
of fine linen, at 6d per Month in the pound,
That's as good as mine own already.
Ah poor Quack, Art thou come into his clutches?
O here it is, here it is, here it is, They are both come
together. Thomas Badluck, 10l to pay 5. and George
•ail 6l to pay 3. both forfeit, and fast enough. There's
16l good besides cost and charges, or there let 'em rot.
Dear Sir, let me be a Suitor for mercy upon
these two.
Mercy! then let me never find mercy, if I
show 'em any.
I prithee, be good to 'em. They have 15 I will∣drone
between 'em, and 9 of them are Motherless. If
they remain in prison, they must all starve.
Hey, tittle tattle, tittle tattle, tittle tattle, Pray
go to your Favourite the King; he'll redeem 'em for the
tother kiss, or if your kisses are grown cheap, for a
nights lodging. Now your Father's a privy Counsellour
you'll have a glorious Pander.
Sir, you wrong three at once, and your self that's
four, and I have a conscience that's a thousand will justi∣fie
it: but I forgive ye.
Forgive me, ye Court Munkey! They say you're
breeding and keep your Chamber, and puke a more∣nings,
and eat Caudels and Cordials in a corner to che∣rich
you after your journey, And my purse must pay
for all, But I'll keep you short.
Heaven and my Innocence comfort me: What
I breed I fear you'll justly father; even that Child will
make us both happy.
I father your Bastard! you extract of Court
Impudence!
O that my hand were turned to Lyons paws that I may
tear thee to bits.
Murder, murder, murder!
Sir, let my arm assist ye.
O I am murdered! O my bonds, my bonds,
my bonds! O let me once embrace ye more my dear
bonds!
O my dear bonds.
Fear not, My arm shall hold you up.
O my leg, my leg! O my bonds, my bonds,
my sweet bonds!
Quack, But I fear twill doe Artesio wrong.
No wrong at all, my Lord: My practice lies
Among the fools, He deals with none but wise.
I, but you promise cure to their disease.
Their money loads 'em, and we give 'em ease.
Why then you rob them for your own relief.
Who takes what's freely offered, is no Thief.
But they expect Recovery of their health.
And we accept what's much inferior, wealth.
They heal your wants, you fail to help their grief.
It is true, our sense exceeds their dull belief.
Can then belief give help to their disease?
Faith in the Doctor gives the Patient, ease.
If these be penny-worths, he's a fool that buys.
If they be fools, our pennyworths make them wise.
But Quack, I know that Mountebanks are bold,
ignorant, and covetous; and when these three qualities
meet and present themselves to the vulgar, who are na∣turally
confident, simple, and admirers of Novelties,
like Files, they'll buzz about the flame till they have burnt
their wings, nay sometimes scorch their bodies too, and
that must not be suffered.
My Lord, we Mountebanks are in that kind
very circumspect: What we prescribe, if it doe no
good, we are confident can doe no harm. For most
of what we give, carries the bare name of Physic, but
is none.
Why doe ye give it then?
To cure our own diseases, and with the help of
a little foolish Faith, theirs too.
But methinks your knavery should quickly be
discovered Quack, what doe ye then?
Why, then we flee to the next good Town,
and there we meet with fresh fools, where if one among
a hundred hap to be cured, he more cries up our credit,
then the ninety nine can disparage it. Every Prize hath
his Trumpet when thousands of Blanks are swallowed
up in silence, that others may be fooled as well as they.
Howsoever, they depart all satisfied, and I dare say, re∣pent
no more of their Sixpences, then they doe of their
sins.
Well Quack, give me thy paper. Once for old
Lactusia's sake, I'll be accessory to a piece of knavery.
Thanks noble Lord, you're principal in my esteem.
Now Quack, screw up thy brains: Provide thee
A fit Man, and him a fit Habit,
And oil thy tongue; that it may neatly cousin
Poor Country-fools as they draw doves, by th'dozen.
Lactusia, I'd have it made up into a Potion, and so con∣vey'd
to her. Can make a Composition?
An't please your Grace, Isle doe my best, but
dare not warrant the present working of it. I have poi∣son'd
many a Rat, but my practice lies no further.
Art acquainted with no Apothecary, that will take
an Anuity of a hundred Mark to doe the feat?
Now I think on it, I have one fit for the pur∣pose,
a man of a desperate fortune, that will bite at such
a Bait. Cornelius Quack, lately Apothecary to Artesio,
who is about to get a License to be a Mountebank.
I'll grant it him, But will he be secret?
Where is he?
I met him just now.
Go find him, And if he entertain the motion,
bring him hither.
I know no fitter man.
But Trippit, In whose name shall we send it to
her?
No better then in her Fathers, He being a Doctor,
and the (as I hear) at this time not well, may send it as
Physic to be taken presently.
Had Quack contemned her Fathers Apothecary
it would have done well, but having left his service, it will
breed suspicion.
What if it should be sent in a Bottle of Greek∣wine,
as a token from one of her Sisters?
I believe there's no such correspondence be∣tween
'em, And besides, Wine of that nature will break
the Glass; and make discovery.
What think thou of counterfeiting a kind Letter from
Evaldus, which shall intimate his notice of her sickness,
and that he hath sent her one of his own Cordials, wish∣her
for his sake; to drink it fasting?
Your Highness has hit it. And he may add, that
he hath drunk her health in the same, which may the bet∣la
endure her to pledge it. It will be a way beyond all
exception.
Look, here's a Letter pend to the same purpose,
read softly.
Madam, teach a Miller to be a Thief; If I
doe not like a workman, let my wages be thereafter.
Madam, here's the man I recommended to your
Highness.
Bring him near, 
You are acquainted with the business?
Yes an't please your Grace, and am ready to
perform it.
Let the Cordial be made of sudden execution,
And convey it to her with this Letter.
Will your Highness be pleased to sign this his
License to practice Physic and Surgery in your Ma∣jesties
Dominions.
Trippit, keep both the License and the Letter,
and put us in mind to sign the one, and seal the other,
Let's away. Fellow, be silent, sudden and circumspect.
Your Grace will bear me out in it.
Doubt it not.
So, now my License will have Authority
enough.
A hundred Marks a year besides, and the Queens Ser∣vant?
I'll venture a hanging upon these terms at any time.
Come,
Art thou there? Ho!
Must my fury await your pleasure!
Must my sweet revenge attend your leisure?
Have I nothing else to doe, but to fig from place, from
Tavern to Tavern, from corner to corner? Must I be
still yowling, and calling, and bawling for you whilst you're
rambling, and roving, and roaming, and potting,
and piping, and drivelling and snivelling! Am I born to
trot after you? to wait upon your tail? or else like a
fool, sit moaping at home, with neither clothes to my
back nor meat for my belly, nor a penny in my purse?
So now the Game begins.
Must I be thus slighted, and scorned, and con∣temn'd,
and undone by a Runagate, a Sneap-nose, a
thin-gut? Must I dance attendance after such a shotten
herring as you? be a slave to such a Sot as you? such a
Bul-pated Milk-sop as you? You a Citizen! you a
Trades-man! you a Husband! you a Companion for
Gentlemen! mary, come up! You must be prankt up
in your Satin Doublet, when I have scarce a Smock to
my back, nor a Shoe to my foot, nor a Tatter to my
tail, nor a hot bit to put into my belly, from Sunday
to Sunday.
Heyday, heyday, heyday!
And heyday, and heyday, and heyday too;
Go heyday your base Trulls, your three-half-peny
draggle-tayl'd Queens, that can endure your heydays,
and your mocks, and your mowes, and your taunts for
an ounce of Coventree-blue.
As I went to Walsingham.
Go, ye weasel-snouted, addle-pated, buzzle∣headed,
splatter-footed Moon-calf. Go whistle your
Dogs, and your flap-mouth'd Whores, that ye car∣ried
to the Tap-house, and then ran away and left them
to pay for the Reck'ning, when they followed ye, and
rung ye by the ears, till they made ye roar like your Mo∣there,
when she was delivered of such a coxcombly Boo∣by
as you.
So, is all out now?
Go, go ye Sycophant, the dregs of the sub∣urbs,
that can murder a Patient for the hopes of a hun∣dred
Marks, and then be turned out of service for your
pains. O how my fingers itch, to set their marks upon
those meager Cheeks of thine! But you Sir know, I have
all your Villainies upon the score, 
and at the next offence,
I'll call ye to Account, and if ye bauke me, then
I ransake ye out, and make ye understand
The sharp-nail'd language of Quisquilla's hand.
It is some comfort yet
I find a warning ere I feel the fit.
I scorn your words, Bellarmo; My spirit flies
As high a pitch as yours, have every whit
As good blood in my veins as you.
Nay good Bellario.
I, to keep for wanton Ladies.
No, to spend in a just cause.
Nay good Palladius.
Come, come, ye dare not.
Provoke me not.
I dare thee to thy face.
Nay, what do ye mean?
Meet me with your Horse and Sword.
I will: To morrow expect to hear from me the
time and place.
So, now it works like wax: Whilst they prepare
To beat the bush, my hound may catch the Hare.
THere's old whispering between them. Pray heaven
they be not hatching of a Cockatrices egg. Look
where they come.
Whore's Phonilla all this day?
Here Madam.
O are ye there? My heart's much oppressed with
melancholy! Come Phonilla; Sing the Song, the King
likes so well.
How blessed are they that wast their weary hours
In solemn Groves, and solitary Bowers,
Where neither eye, nor ear,
Can see, or hear,
The frantic mirth,
And false delights of frolic earth;
Where they may sit, and pant,
And breathe their pursy souls,
Where neither Grief consumes, nor griping want
Afflicts, nor sullen Care controls.
Away false joys, ye murder where ye kiss:
There is no heaven to that; No life to this.
Truth, sweetly sung. Come let's away. 
Murder will out: A Letter, and a silver Cup!
To the fair hands of the most honourable Lady, the La∣die
Kettreena these. Good. So much for the preface,
Now to the business. 
The ill Construction of our loves, enforces me to whi∣sper
my Affection in the Sympathy of thy sufferings:
Cheer up, and let thy courage for a while bear what
present time cannot remedy. Receive this Cordial, as a
dear pledge of my love, and a certain means of thy
health: It will restore thy wasted spirits, and wind up
the plum•ets of thy weakened Constitution, It will fill
thy heart with mirth, and bones with marrow, whose
welfare is the studious care of
Evaldus? So now it is out. Ho! does the Jade begin to
tyre? Must her Plummets be wound up? Nay, It shall have
my Blessing too, I had a dose of Arsnick 
But it is gone. Well, if I cannot make it fit for her, the
King has made it fit for me: Let me see 
Twill fill thy heart with mirth, and bones with marrow.
Good! Muth and Marrow, and a silver Cup, three
good Commodities! First I'll up with this. So—
Now I'll up with that 
Evaldus, we thank ye. Kettreena, we thank ye,
Health and wealth's a double purchase.
Sir, if mine eyes may not be made partakers of
the Kings Message, make my ears happy with your Re∣lotion.
Do ye want Restority? Are the plummets of
your soul downer? Does your heart want mirth? or
your bones marrow?
Sir, What mean ye?
Most honourable Lady, to cut your throat: A∣way
ye Strumpet.
Sir, will you be pleased—
To slit your nose; Avoid my sight 
O what aisle I! In the name of Gold what aisle my
bowels thus to gripe? Oh! Her very breath's a Purge;
Her eyes are Grenades, and have set my blood on fire.
I burn like Hell: My liver scorches; My heart is in a
fornace, O water, water, water! O, for a Crust of Ice,
that I may gnaw and cool my flaming tongue! Oh,
my legs begin to fail, I faint, I faint, I faint! Oh that
this earth were snow that I might roll, and roll, and
roll! Where are ye ô my bags, my blessed bags! help
me, ô help me my dear bags. Oh, will ye suffer me to
be thus tormented! What are ye deaf now? are ye
dumb? Take, take away the Witch; she comes, she
comes, she comes to pinch me with hot Irons, &amp; fills my
veins with boiling lead. O the Witch, the Witch, the
Witch, the Witch.
What? fallen asleep! How miserable is poor
Kettreena that has no happiness but then! How well
quietness becomes him! He lies very still; He was wont
to snort, that the whole house was witness of his slum∣bers,
I'm loath to wake him.
I'm afraid he's dead. Sir, Sir, Sir. 
Oh, he's dead! He's dead! He's dead! 
utterly dead, dead for ever.
Dear Sister, what's the matter?
O he's dead, he's dead, he's dead!
Nay, sweet Sister, have patience.
Oh, woe is me, that I have lived to see this heavy
hour!
Pray Sister be patient, you wrong your self too
much.
I care not, so long as I never wronged him. Oh
my dear Husband is dead, and I am undone, undone
for ever!
Come, pray Sister leave the room, and take
some comfort; Your tears cannot recall him.
No, no, I'll never leave him, I'll never leave
him thus.
Come, come, let me persuade ye. Nay come,
good Sister.
Then let me take my last farewell: Deny me
not that good Brother. 
I hope he's happier far then I.
Conscience! What tell thou me of Consci∣ence?
Conscience, and Commodity, are two several
Trades: If thou keep the one, the other will scarce keep
thee. Conscience, quoth her? I cry my stars mercy.
There's a word indeed! You a Mountebanks man! You
a hang-man as soon. Tell me of Conscience?
I beseech you, Sir, excuse me. It was but a ha∣sty
word let slip, before I was aware.
He that's my servant must forget to blush,
Must teach his ready lips to mouth an oath,
Must have a daring brow, hatched ore with brass;
Must have a smooth-fac'd tongue, that has the Art
To cloth a naked Lie with robes of Truth;
And learn to work upon the easy faith
Of the believing Multitude: He must be bold
And plausible, and captivate the ear
With lines of wit; And with some bugbear words
Of seeming Art, must fright their understandings
Into an Admiration.
Which, like a nightly Lowbell, may entice
The amazed Plebeans to his Batfoule net.
Quibble, what say to this?
Sir, if you'd be pleased to excuse me a little for
swearing, I should do well enough for lying. For indeed, I
must confess, swearing goes a little against my conscience.
More conscience yet? Come, come, ye must not
Stand upon such Niceties: He that will thrive
Must fear to act no profitable Crime:
Almighty Gold hath power to absolve
The evils of poverty: He may be bold
To sin in want, that may repent in Gold.
Well Sir, I am resolved. Conscience, farewell.
And now that Blocks removed, Quibble shall undertake
your fair Instructions, and approve himself a Scholar
worthy of so sage a Master.
But one thing more;
When you shall mount my Stage
Be sure, your lavish tongue reflect upon
The honour of my Name: let all your words
Aim at my merits, and enhance my fame,
Advance my Cures, And let thy tongue relate
The greatness of my Patients, and rewards
Of foreign Princes, and those powers above.
It is eafier to believe, then to disprove.
It is enough: If Quibble undertake,
And fail, trust neither fool nor knave for Quibble's fake.
The Queen's extremely discontent, that her de∣signs
have fallen so cross.
Who can help it?
This is the fruit of Jealousy; had not that
peevish fool been jealous of Kettreena, My conscience
tells me this had never been.
Nay, to see the old fool must needs run upon
his own death, and not suffer her to die, whose death he
so desired!
Well, it was the first time that I was ere engaged
in such a business, and shall be the last.
Nay, to see the luck on it, The counterfeited
Letter was found in Pertenax his pocket, and may dis∣cover
all.
But my fear is, that Quack will be examined,
and then all will out.
No, Quack did wisely deliver his Message in a
disguise; can he but keep his own counsel, all may be
well. In the mean while, I have given out that Kettreena
had a hand in the business, which perchance may prove
an after-game, and strengthened with report may leave
her to the Law.
I send a Letter and a Cordial! I'm abused.
It appears, the mischief was meant to Kettree∣na,
Sir.
But heaven protected her: Who brought the
Letter and the Potion?
The Messenger was a Stranger, Sir.
How habitat?
Sir, like a Cavalier, in a slashed Suit, a black Lock,
And a gilt Rapier, down to his heels.
We will make a strict enquiry; Such murder will
not long lie smothered. But how does poor Kettreena
take it?
Exceeding heavily Sir, And the worse, that some
base tongues would make her accessory.
My soul acquits her. Artesio, let her know,
we will visit her to morrow. Bid her from me cheer up;
Upon my honour I'll not rest, till she be righted.
Heaven bless your Highness.
It is certain, there's a challenge passed betwixt
Bellarmo, and Palladius: I fear the unhappy difference
concerning the Birthright, will never be composed but
by the Oracle. On Wednesday is their Birth-day, and
most fit for such solemnity: Formidon, let proclamation
be issued forth, that all the Court, upon the pain of our
displeasure that day await the Oracle, where we in per∣son
will attend it. Artesio send you warrant out in our
name to the Pythian Priests to make their Preparations.
So now Mucous, If the plot hit right
There's but a hair twixt Monarchy and thee:
The Gap stands fair; If thy auspicious stars
Light thee the way, and prosperous Fortune breathe
Success upon thy high contrived designs,
Thy sole-commanding hand, shall grasp and sway
The glorious Sceptre, and thy gracious Brows
Shall be encompassed with the Imperial Crown.
But stay! What if Palladius should advise
With his soft Pillow? what if pleading tears
Softly distilling from the amorous eyes
Of his fair Idol should prevail and turn
His martial flames into a love-sick fire?
What if the blaze of our Bellarmo's rage
(Not having solid Fuel to maintain
The wasteful bounty of his lavish flames)
Should slake and languish, and consume it self
To the warm ashes of a soft accord?
Here, here, Mucous, thou must act thy part
With Care and Judgment, and ingenious Art.
Be circumspect; Be studious to increase
Those Fires: Their wars produce thy Peace.
Be thou the Bellows to advance their flame:
And having wisely dealt, play thus thy Game.
First bait thy hook with deep dissembled love,
Keep close thy Serpent, and show them thy Dove:
Seem Friend to both; Who ever failed his End,
That hammered treason with the hands of Friend?
Feel both their pulses: If they chance to beat
Active and sprightly, wish, advise, entreat
To Peace: Persuaded fury, and stopped streams
When most resisted, run to most extremes:
But if their tilted spirits run too low,
Urge Reputation, and the faith they owe
To sacred Honour in a Princes name:
The whet-stone of abated Valour's shame.
But see, how pat Palladius presence gives
A fair advantage to my new desires!
Isle stand aside, until his serious eyes
Have given free welcome to his paper-guests.
I stand betwixt two minds! what's best to doe?
This bids me stay; This spurs me on to go.
Once more let our impartial eyes peruse
Both t'one and t'other: Both may not prevail.
My Lord,
PRize not your honour so much as to disprize her that ho∣nurse
you, in choosing rather to meet Death in the field,
then Pulchrella in her desires. Give my affection leave
once more to dissuade you from trying Conquest with so un∣equal
a Foe: Or if a Combat must be tried, make a Bed
of Roses the Field, and me your Enemy. The Interest I claim
in you is sufficient warrant to my desires, which according
to the place they find in your Respects, confirm me either
the happiest of all Ladies, or make me the most unfortunate
of all women.
PULL CHRELLA.
A Charm too strong for Honour to repress.
A heart too poor for Honour to possess.
Honour must stoop to Vows. But what says this?
My Lord,
THe hand that guides this Pen, being guided by the am∣bition
of your honour, and my own affection, presents
you with the wishes of a faithful servant, who desires not to
buy your safety with the hazard of your Reputation. Go on
with courage, and know, Panthea shall partake with you in
either fortune: If conquered, my heart shall be your Monu∣meant,
to preserve and glorify your honoured ashes; If a Con∣queror,
my tongue shall be your Herald to proclaim you the
Champion of our Sex, and the Phoenix of your own, honoured
by all, equalled by few, beloved by none more dearly then
Your own Panthea.
I sail betwixt two Rocks! What shall I doe?
What Marble melts not if Pulchrella woo?
Or what hard-hearted ear can be so dead,
As to be deaf, if fair Panthea plead?
Whom shall I please? Or which shall I refuse?
Pulchrella sues, and fair Panthea sues:
Pulchrella melts me with her love-sick tears,
But brave Panthea batters down my ears
With Love's Patter: Pulchrellas breast encloses
A soft Affection wrapped in Beds of Roses.
But in the rare Pantheas noble lines,
True Worth and Honour, with Affection joins.
I stand even-balanc'd, doubtfully oppressed,
Beneath the burden of a bivious breast.
When I peruse my sweet Pulchrellas tears,
My blood grows wanton, and I plunge in fears:
But when I read divine Panthea's charms,
I turn all fiery, and I grasp for arms.
Who ever saw, when a rude blast out-braves,
And thwarts the swelling Tide, how the proud waves
Rock the drenched Pinnace on the Sea-greene breast
Of frowning Ahimptrite, who oppressed
Betwixt two Lords, (not knowing which to obey)
Remains a Neuter in a doubtful way.
So tossed am I, bound to such strair confines,
Betwixt Pulchrella's and Panthea's lines.
Both cannot speed: But one that must prevail.
I stand even poised: an Atom turns the scale.
Dare thou be doubtful? Fie, Palladius, fie.
How now? What, is Mucous care so nigh!
Lend me thy grave advice: Peruse these lines,
My choice shall fix on what thy judgment fings.
Read both. Compare and judge.
Weigh Heaven with Hell:
Compare harsh Owls to warbling Philomel:
Weigh Froth with Honour, or dejected Shame
With the downe-weight of an illustrious Name.
Pulchrella woos thee with a Sirens song;
But brave Panthea's more Heroic tongue
Chants strains of honour: False Pulchrella sheds
The tears of Crocodiles: Panthea treads
High steps to triumph, where thy growing Name.
Shall stand recorded in the Rolls of Fame.
But take thy course: Th'advice is only mine:
Thine is the interest, as the choice is thine.
This only know, Bellarmo's tongue proclames
Palladius dares not fight, but with his dames.
The scales are turned. Panthea lodge thou here
Next to my heart, Pulchrella, lie thou there.
Farewell my soft embraces: Sports stand by:
Bellarmo, if Palladius lives, shall die.
So, now it works: If either hap to fall,
I the sole-second to both parties shall
With my breathed sword doe justice on the other:
Crowns weigh no friends: Ambition knows no brother.
Then, then, Mucous, shall the Imperial Crown
Adorn thy sacred Temples; and the Throne
Of Earth's unrivalled Majesty shall be
Thy purchased Prize, possessed alone by Thee.
Then shall those golden, those forgotten days
Return to earth: Then shall the learned Baize
That wants deservers, in this trifling Age,
Immortalise the Sophoclean Stage:
Unbroken Faith shall then forget to start,
And be entailed upon the single heart.
Unblemished Loyalty shall crown the loves
Of twined souls, more innocent then Doves.
But stay, Mucous! Thou forget to play
The tother part with thy Bellarm', Away:
Go feel his humour: If his rage be down,
Go switch it up: Thou labour for a Crown.
BE it known to all men by these presents, that I
Jeffery Quibble, am the trusty and right well∣beloved
servant and kinsman to the renowned,
famous, skilful, learned, able, admirable, incomparable
Master of Phisgigge, Cornelius Quack, a man of rare
Qualcoms, and singular imperfections, who by his studies
abroad, and travels at home, through France, Spain, Ita∣lie,
Germany, Denmark, Poland, Finderland, Freezeland,
hath marvellously unbefitted himself with all manner of
Oils, Waters, Powders, Drugs, Spirits, Balsomes, Syrops,
Salves, Sere-cloathes; bountifully unstor'd with all sorts of
Preservatives, Conservatives, Restoritives, Antidotes, for
all manner of Temperatures, Constitutions, Complexions;
Richly unfurnished with all kind of Prescripts, Deceits, and
all other rare Impediments belonging to a man of his De∣function,
who to the great dimolishment of this Town, and
benefice of this Incorruption, hath redressed himself to you,
and here sets up his Bank, offering health to the imperfer∣mity
of your bodies, soundness to the impudence of your
limbs, and present cure to your outward Mallanders, and
inward exturbances. And for your farther sartifaction of
his deficiency in this kind, Behold his Licence under the
hands of her most Excellent Majesty, and Bellarmo her
illustrious son; which, when occasion shall require it, shall
be shown, to the honour of my renowned Master, Cornelius
Quack, and his pragmaticall servant Jeffery Quibble.
But to the purpose, Gentlemen: It may be you will think
me more knave then fool, And may be so I am: And now
perchance you'll say I'm both by my own confession: And
may be I am so too. Artesio my old Master made me a knave,
and my new Master hath made me a fool: And so he'll doe
ye all before he has done with ye. Which that he may the better
doe, have patience a while.
Gentlemen, Here's that will doe the deed. Here's Physic
of all kinds, for all diseases: Salves of all natures for all
sores: Medicines of all compositions, for all constitutions,
colours, of all sorts, for all complexions.
The costly Powder in this box
Cures him that's pouder'd with the Pox.
This helps the back, and cures the Reyns;
Makes her weight that wants two grains.
The Ointment that this glass encloses,
Palliats blew cheeks, and purple noses.
This cures the Cholick, Stone, or Wind,
Makes crazed bodies belch behind.
This cures the careful married life
Of that disease men call a Wife.
This clears complexion when it fades;
Cures Falling-sicknesses in maids.
This cures the twattles, and the flouts;
Grumbles, sullens, and the pouts.
This helps all gouts both old and young,
And cures the palsy in the tongue.
This makes night-walkers keep their beds;
Cures heavy hearts, and giddy heads.
If Jack love Jon, and Jon fly back,
This powder will make Jon love Jack.
If Jon love Jack, and Jack will none,
This powder will make Jack love Jon.
This first and last if ye apply,
You'll ne'er be sick but when ye die.
But this rare Quintessence such strength does give,
You'll never die so long as ere ye live.
Gentlemen, This is a rare man, (though I say it) and
hath a thousand secrets more, which next market day
you shall have from his own plentiful mouth. He hath
done rare cures by natural Magic, Sympathies, and
Antipathies; But this is Heathen Greek to you: Who
would have conceived that Sir Walter Raleighs blood
should have cured Goudomors Fistula in ano? But this is
likewise Greek to you: We'll leave these mysteries to
the wise, and tell ye things according to the measure of
our apprehensions.
My Master had for taking a Corn out of the great
Moguls toe,—100.1. sterling.
For strengthening the Pr: of Orange's back, 1000. Guilders.
For curing the Emperor of a Dropsy, 4000. Rx Dollars.
For taking a black Cataract out of his Holiness his left
eye,—600. Checkeens.
For curing Card: Richelieu of the Kings evil, 800. French
Crowns.
Well Gentlemen, to be short, My Master loves money
woundly well, and so does my Masters man. If therefore
ye want any thing, grease my fist with a Tester or two,
and ye shall find it in your penny-worths. And why
should not I cheat him with as good a conscience, as he
you?
But stay! We must have a parting song, before ye
go. Sirrah, Jack, Rogue, Boy, Hoe Jack!
O are you come, Sirrah! Sing these Gentlemen a song.
Come, be nimble, Twill be your own another day.
IS any sick? Is any sore
Oppressed with Qualms and fainting fits?
Or bound behind? Or loose before?
Has any Lover lost his wits?
Let him draw near,
And make his griefs appear,
We'll cure them all from top to toe,
Before, behind, above, below.
Is any heart oppressed with dolor?
Sullen, sad, or melancholy?
Ore-flowne with blood? inflamed with choler?
Or surcharged with Phlegm or folly?
Let him draw near,
And make his griefs appear,
We'll ease ye all, what ere ye feel,
Within, without, from head to heel.
Is any foul that would be fair?
Would Rav'ns appear as white as Lambs?
Has any Courtier lost his hair?
Or finds a crickling in his hams?
Let him draw near,
And make his griefs appear,
We'll cure all their wants throughout,
Above, below, within, without.
Has any Morpheus, Freckles, Stains,
Warts, or Wounds, or Wens, or Scar's?
Blisters, Botches, Biles, or Blanes,
Coughs, Consumptions, Colds, Caters?
Let them draw near,
And make their griefs appear,
We'll make them sound from bone to skin,
Above, below, without, within.
Chollicks, Fevers, Palseyes, Flux,
Cancers, Dropsies, nauseous Fumes?
Megrims, Skirvies, Cramps, or Cricks,
Iaundies, Rickets, Piles, or Rhumes?
Let them draw near,
And make their griefs appear,
We'll give them ease, and health restore,
Within, without, behind, before.
Tic a good Boy!
Now Gentlemen, you've heard the truth both sung and
said, confirmed by fools and children, who ye know
speak truth. If after all this ye cannot believe, we have
lost our breath, and you the benefit.
But to confirm your Confidence, and to magnific the
excellence of our skill, I will present such visible demon∣strations
to your eye, that Doubt shall find no ground to
question, and Unbelief shall blush at her own infidelity.
And first,
Here is a Sovereign Balsam, that in the space of one
minute and three quarters, shall cure the deepest wound
that dagger can inflict, whereof behold sufficient proof.
Gentlemen, this wound which I have made, shall by
the virtue of this Balsam be as quickly cured.
So, now the blood retires unto his wonted veins, I
feel the Orifice, which even just now had room enough
to lodge my finger, now closed, and smooth, and flesh
delivered from the sense of pain.
Secondly, here is an excellent Antidote, which taken,
shall preserve the taker from the injury of poison, hot or
cold. As for example—
This ugly Spider here contains the rankest of all venom.
Now Gentlemen, I take my Antidote.
And now my Spider.
Tic gone! Fight Dog, fight Bear. Hem!
Poison doe thy worst. Ho! Dost thou rejounce?
Thy power's curbed, and cannot work her end.
Needs fear no Foe, that hath so true a friend.
Thirdly, here's a sovereign Restorative which shall
correct the deadliest poison in the height of operation.
See ye this swelling Toad, whose poison taken shall swell
ye till ye burst, And from the very Porch of Death this
rare Preservative shall soon redeem ye. Gentlemen,
mark how I squeeze this mortal bit into this Boule.
Now Gallants, a Health to my Mistress.
Now pledge it that dare. Mark the operation, Hem!
Hem! Hem! Now it begins to work, O I am sick, my
bowels gripe, I sweat, I burn, I burst—
O what a Julep breathes into my veins!
And how these strong Convulsions of my soul
Begin to loosen! How the loathsome Qualms
Of my obstructed stomach turns to ease
And appetite! O sovereign drop
How, how hast thou restored my dying life
With thy unvalued excellence, and lent
My tongue new power to call thee excellent!
Now, my Masters, you that delight in Chemistry,
know also, my Master can show you many rare Expire∣mints.
He says he can make the Philosophers Stone,
but saving his Reverence I think he lies, else he'd be
hanged ere he'd thus Quack for Testers.
But this upon my knowledge: he can bring an Artifi∣ciall
Resurrection, and Vivification to Mercury, which
being mortified into a thousand shapes, assumes again
its own Body, and returns to its numerical self. He
can likewise from the Ashes of a Plant, revive the Plant,
and from its Cinders recall it to the Stalk and Leaves
again. Lastly, by the virtue of a thing called Wit, he
can doe such wonders at Cribbage, or New-cut, that
the experience thereof shall teach ye more wisdom in
an hour, then all the Volume of Thomas Equines can
afford you in ten days: Wherein if you please the next
market day he shall give you a plenary satisfaction, if
you repair hither with purses to be handled, and minds
to be instructed.
Well Madge, though I pawn my Poppingay
Petticoat for it, Isle have some of that powder next market
day.
What powder Cis?
That powder that will make Jack love Ione.
P'sh, I don't think twill work any such of∣fact.
Yes Madge, as sure as I live. Doll our Dairy-maid
gave some on it to Nick the Butlers boy, and within an
hour after the boy was so mad of her: He would never
let her alone, but dogged her from corner to corner, and
would so tumble her and so touse her: And when com∣pany
was by her would so gloit and cast sheeps eyes at
her, as past. She could go no where but the boy would
make one. Sometimes he would bring her May-bushes,
sometimes mellow-Apples, sometimes a Busk-point,
sometimes a Silk-lace. And if she spake but a kind word
to him, Lord, he would so simper, and so jemper, and so
lick his lips, and so scratch his elboe, as it was admirable.
Is it possible?
I tell thee Madge, I saw it with my own eyes,
and thought the next time the Mountebank came I'd
buy some on it to see what mettle our Frank the Faulkner
was made on.
Why sirrah, he loves thee well enough with∣out
it: Would I know who loved me half so well.
Yes verily, I confess I think he loves me dearly
well, but yet not so dearly as I'd have him. He's such a
maidenly man!—
Why? I'm sure I saw him kiss thee twenty
times together, to be sure so often that my teeth watered
soundly.
Twenty times? what's twenty times? what's
that? It is done before one can say What's this? Twen∣tie
times? Tic a mighty piece of business. And then
forsooth, he must stroke his Hawk, And then forsooth
he must feed his Hawk, and then forsooth, he must
bathe his Hawk, And then forsooth, he must lie down
by his Hawk, and see his Hawk pick her self, and prune
her self, and there's such a deal of fiddling, and such a
deal of fiddling, And then forsooth, he must go abroad
a hawking, and stay out all day, and then at night come
home as weary as his dogs, and sit without life or soul,
That one has as much comfort in him as comes to no∣thing.
Well Cis, would some body did but love
me half so well, a that condition it cost me a fall.
Goodly, goodly, would Antony at George were
here to draw his name out a your politic mouth, You
are so close, and so wise now.
Why, I am not ashamed to name him,
nor he of his name: Well, he has cost me many a bitter
sigh in his days, Yet I dare take my oath hoe's as honest
a young man as lives by bread.
Why dost thou sigh? He may leave his honesty
when he will, and see ne'er a whit the worse for it.
I care not, so he left it with no body but me;
yet in the way of honesty too (I tell ye but so:) Well,
no body knows what I have endured for his sake; But
I may thank my modesty for it, and my Mother for that.
She gave my a Rule forsooth, once, which I have beshrew'd
her for a thousand times.
What Rule was that, Madge?
She charged me, that when any sued for my
love, I should be coy, and say Noforsooth, and still No∣forsooth,
and Noforsooth, which I ha'done so long,
that I have almost Noforsooth'd away all my fortunes.
But sirrah, (here's none but Thee and I) Isle tell thee.
This very day two months (well fare all good tokens)
Antony at the George would needs ha'me down into
his Wine-celler, and gave me a Pint of Brown-bastard;
and being in a good humour, brake his mind to me,
And taking a glass of Wine, wished it might be his
poison if he did not love me with all his heart.
But did he drink it?
Every drop as I live; Nay more, would may
ne'er store, if he offered not (Isle tell it to thee) to fetch
a Licence instantly, and marry me forthwith, if I'd
go with him; But I, like a puppinos'd fool, followed
my Mothers directions, and cried Noforsooth, to
make him the more eager, which he taking in earnest,
flung away in a pet, and as I live, took me at my word,
and never spake kindly to me since: And this is the
fruits of Noforsooth.
And were thou not served in thy kind, to be
such an ass, to refuse a good thing when it was of∣fer'd?
Nay, Sirrah, See the luck on it; Had he but asked
me once more, I had resolved to ha'taken him at his
word: But if he, or any other hereafter take Madge a
crying Noforsooth, I'll give him leave to bite off my
tongue, and spit it in my face, I tell ye but so.
Dost thou think he has forsaken thee upon it?
I can't tell: I ha'made many a frivolous
errand to the George since, And when he sees me, the
Gentleman will bite his lip, and put off his hat, but as I
live, neither kiss me, nor nothing else, That I came a∣way
with a flea in mine ear, and in a fustian Fret, and
had such Qualms, and such Swamps come over my
stomach all night long—
But art not mightily troubled with him in thy
dreams?
O, sirrah, abomination; There's ne'er a night
scopes me, on my conscience: Sometimes, methinks I
see him twirling up his pretty little black beard: some∣times
stroking up his fore-top: sometimes singing that
heavenly tune of Walsingham to his Citterne: sometimes
crying Anon Anon Sir, and running up stairs: sometimes
Very welcome Gentlemen, Is all paid i'th'Rose? which
he fetches up with such a grace—As indeed every thing
he does becomes him most sweetly. O how I could curse
this peevish tongue of mine for saying that last Nofor∣sooth.
Ah! if he had asked me the Question but once
more, verly I had been to morrow two months gone:
But who can help it?
Well Madge, our conditions are much alike: we
must even comfort one another as well as we can.
That's but cold comfort Cis: I but my case
is thousand times worse then thine; Thou may see
him thou love every day, and dine together, and sup
together, and sleep together under the same roof; but
I a poor forsaken creature must waste my disconsolate
hours in thinking, &amp; in sighing, and in [Weeps] sobbing.
Insomuch that I have not eaten a bit of bread that has done
me any good these three days. But yet I can't choose
but laugh to think —Ha, ha, ha, ha, how Frank the Fawlk∣ner
—Ha, ha, ha, ha, was caught in's Roguery last night,
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
How? Prithee tell me.
I think my heart will burst when I think on it.
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
Prithee tell me the conceit.
Sirrah, yesternight when thou were gone up
with my Lady, Frank and I were raking Husbands and
Wives in the Embers, And Frank hearing the stayres
creak, and thinking thee had been coming down,
caught my Lady fast by the —Ha, ha, ha, ha, middle; but
she lent him such a whirrit upon the ear, that all the
house rung on it: But it would make a Horse break his
Halter to see how like an Ass poor Frank looked and
sneaked away with his tail clapped between his legs, Ha, ha,
ha, ha, Did he not tell thee on it yet?
No verily, I see him not to day: Huts lifelykins,
Alas poor heart, But it is no matter: Let him keep home
adays then, that he may see what he does, and whom he
embraces. But sirrah, now I think on it, I ha some a
Dolls powder, which I stole from her, Till we get more,
let's try conclusions with that.
With all my heart, let's: But how shall we
give it them?
How? Leave that to me: Frank and I will go
to the George, and drink a pint with Antony, and then
we'll send for thee, And I warrant thee Isle spice their
Cups, and then
In spite of my mother, my grandam, my aunt,
We'll drink off our cups, and make a night on it.
A match! Come, let's way; we shall be
both hanged for staying so long.
Artesio, Can you resolve us yet concerning
the death of Pertenax?
Sir, he was opened, and we apparently find that
he was poisoned.
Go Artesio, and comfort thy poor afflicted
daughter, Let her know, that we are partners in her for∣row,
and will be a husband to the widow, and take her
welfare into our protection.
Heaven bless your Highness.
Does there appear any new light by your
Examination?
Sir, I find there was such a Letter counter∣feited
from your Highness, and a silver Cup was delive∣red
to Kettreena by a stranger, who after the delivery in∣stantly
departed. Likewise I find that Pertenax com∣ming
in the nick, snatched it from Kettreena's unwilling
hand, and in a passion retired into a room, not suffering
her to follow him, where he was found dead an hour
after.
Another Examinate faith, that he sent for a dram
of Arsnick the night before, but for what purpose the
Examinate knows not.
Another Examinate, being one of his fervants, saith,
that she harkening at the door, did hear him say, that
he would put in a dose of Arsnick into the Cup for? Ket∣treena,
which she saw him search in his pockets for; but
being suddenly called away by her Lady, stayed not to
see the rest. And indeed it is generally believed, that he
was chief Agent in his own death.
Comodus, what account can you give us of this
business?
Sir, we found in his pocket the Cup and the
Letter, but no Arsnick: Upon suspicion I examined Ma∣dam
Lactusia, and one Cornelius Quack, once servant to
Artesio, who falter something in their examination, but
deny any knowledge of the proceedings: Only they
both hear that Pertenax counterfeited the Letter, to
see with what Affection his Lady would receive it.
Even like enough, The just reward of a jealous
brain.
But this she added, That when time should serve,
she would discover a secret of another nature, which will
make such an alteration in the State, as Time could not
example: whereupon I committed them both to Prison
till a farther Examination.
It was wisely done.
See a firm Conveyance made of all Perte∣nix
his Estate to our use, which we freely give to Ket∣treena.
And you Comodus, take a special care to call in
her debts that are upon Book and Specialties.
THe Devil a bit of meat have I gotten these nine
days, but once a lean scrag end of a Neck of
Mutton, which one of my Masters Patients
loathed to eat: Else my whole diet hath been nothing
but the overplus of thin Physick-broth, and my drink,
the heartless reversion of dis-curded Posset-Ale: Inso∣much,
I had rather be my Masters Hang-man, then his
Serving-man; For then perchance I might get a Caft
Suit, and a gratuity for a quick dispatch.
Who's at door there?
Sir, Is Master Doctor within? I have brought
him a Urine.
From whom?
From my Lady Albion.
My Master is very busy, and cannot be spoken
with these two hours.
Good Sir, my business is upon life and death:
I pray bring me to him, and I shall be very thankful.
How shall that appear?
By this small carnest of a greater Reward.
Well Sir, I shall make a trial. 
Sir, here is one would speak with you from my Lady
Albion.
Bring him in.
Now friend, what's your business?
Sir, my Lady hath sent you her Urine, and de∣sires
your Advice.
Glisterpipe.
Sir.
Go ayre it.
Now Id as lief he had bid me gone to supper,
but take him in that fault, &amp; hang him. 
So, now am I as sure of a cracked Crown, as my Master
is of a whole Angel: But Isle serve him a trick, and save
my self some labour. Isle make it up again out of my
own stock.
Has your Lady made no use of any other Doctor
formerly?
Yes Sir, she took advice of a Scottish Doctor,
but she is not much the better for him: He drew a great
deal of money from her Ladyship, who is now fine to
give him money to be rid on him—Whisper.
Tic all but Peace, and tic not the first time my
Master has had an eye to my water.
Truly I cannot tel Sir.
This water shows no great defect in her Ladyships
stomach.
His Doctorship may swear it.
Her Ladyship accustoms her self to too thin a
diet, eats too much broth, and too many Sillibubs.
Posset-Ale ye mean Sir, a halter stretch ye.
And does not encourage her stomach with good
substantial meat.
Thanks to your miserable purse Sir, he would
if he could get it.
Her Ladyships body is much out of order, and
there's a Malignant Hypocondriacall Flate within her,
which fumes up, and disturbs her Head: Is she not much
troubled with the Head-ache?
Yes Sir, exceedingly: She complains of it eve∣rye
day.
She is likewise much troubled with inflammations,
and obstructions in the liver, which causes an inordinate
swimming in the Brain, and giddiness. Is she not apt
now and then to speak idly?
O Sir, when the Fit takes her, she speaks never a
word of sense: she talks of nothing but Bishops, and
Petitions, and I can't tell what, and her tongue runs so
wildly, and indeed I think she is scarce sensible some∣times
of her own sickness.
That proceeds altogether from the rude conflu∣ence
of loose humours. I find by her water, she is much
troubled with wind and choler, which occasions a great
and frequent heart-burning: Is she not much subject to
unaccustomed sadness at times?
Extremely Sir.
I find she has a great imbeeility in her spirits
natural, which causes in her a general faintness, and
now and then inclined to the Cardiaca Passio. Is she not
often possessed with sudden frights, and fears, and jealou∣sies,
and mis-understandings?
Exceedingly Sir.
I find likewise, that she is much troubled with
the Spleen, which occasions stupidity, melancholy,
and at times distractions? Is she not often in a brown
study?
Very much Sir.
Well, I fear we must be forced to draw some
blood from her, which as the case stands now with her,
I should be loath to doe. There is some bad blood in her
veins; but if a vein be once opened, the best blood in
her body may chance to pass too, which she can hardly
spare, without palpable danger. Until I see her, I can
prescribe little. To morrow I shall wait upon her Lady∣ship,
and what I shall then find fitting, shall be carefully
administered. In the mean while, let her keep her head
warm, and be very careful of her Temples: Let her for∣bear
Salt and Usquebagh: Let her use Moderation in
her Exercises, wherein she might not be forced to lift
her arms too near her head: And for the relieving of
her drooping spirits let her recreate her self now and
then with a game at Irish: Ler her forbear Noddy, and
Chess, as Games too serious. Farewell.
Take this, Glisterpipe, to drink my Ladies
health.
How odoriserous is a very stool! how sweet,
When full-cramm'd Purses, and crazed Bodies meet!
What? more Fees yet? Who's at door?
Pray is Mr. Doctor within?
I have brought him a water.
From whom?
From my Lady Temple.
He cannot be spoken with as yet, unless—
I know your mind, Sir, let this quicken you.
Glisterpipe?
Sir.
Who's there?
One that would speak with your Honour from
my Lady Temple.
Bring him in: Now friend, what's your busi∣ness?
Sir, my Lady desires your Advice upon her
Urine.
Glisterpipe, go chafe it.
So, there's a shilling more for Glisterpipe.
How long has your Lady been sick?
These three years, Sir: she took a tedious jour∣ney
to Canterbury, where she conceives she took a surfeit
with too much Duck, which hath lain very heavy upon
her Ladyships stomach ever since.
This water shows a great diftemper in her prin∣cipall
Parts, which indeed sets her whole Frame out of
Order. Has she taken no Advice formerly?
Sir, she has had many Advisers, but men of
mean quality, and of no skill at all.
What were they?
Her poor Neighbours Sir, Cobblers, Weavers,
Felt-makers, Coachmen, and Brewers Clerks, who pre∣tend
a great deal of slovenly skill.
In good time! But what Doctors had she?
Some Doctors of very good worth, but this
Rabble jeers them, and laughs them out of doors.
I find by her Water she has a foul Liver, &amp; can
digest no wholesome food: And her first digestion being
bad, makes her second worse: Is she not apt to frights?
Sir, her Ladyships stomach was prettily well
purged of her Canterbury Duck, and being finely at ease,
and laid to rest, a rude company of cock-brain'd Rascals
in an humour beset her house, and brake down all her
Glass-windows, and put her into such a fright, that she
has been the worse for it ever since.
I find by her water, there has been too sudden
Alterations in her constitution: Is she not sometimes ve∣rye
hot, and sometimes very cold?
Yes Sir, sometimes as cold as Charity, some∣times
as hot as Zeal.
I find obnoxious fumes rising from her stomach,
and stupefying her brain: Is she not at times very
drowsy?
Yes Sir, Insomuch that the common people
think she is troubled with a Liturgic.
A Lethargy you mean. It is a Chronicall dis∣ease,
and time must cure it. But let her know, that so
long as she entertains this rude Rabble of unsanctified
Mechanics, She can never prosper in her health. Till
she banish them, there will be no room for me. Fare
ye well.
But hear ye. Let her Fasting be frequent, and her
Prayers, Common.
Sir, I shall pray for your Ladies health.
Fast too.
A fair Reward! Tic Supper time: Isle hence.
My Pater Nosters shall be like her Pence.
1. Great Apollo, we adore thee.
2. We importune, we implore thee.
2. Thus we prostrate fall before thee.
1. Sacred Phebus draw thee nigher.
2. Grant the boon that we desire.
3. And resent our. holy Fire.
1. Thou before whose open eye
2. All unshadowed secrets lye,
3. Clear our doubts, and make reply.
1. When Evaldus shall lay down,
Shall Bellarmo wear the Crown?
Apollo lies: This is the Oracle I appeal to.
On pain of death, keep silence there. Proceed.
2. When Evaldus shall lay down,
Shall Palladius were the Crown?
Nay now Apollo's ignorant or unjust.
Silence once more. The next disturberdies. Proceed.
3. When Evaldus shall lay down,
Shall Mucous wear the Crown?
1 When Evaldus shall lay down,
2 3 Whose head then shall wear the Crown?
The Babe unborn shall end the strife,
Whose Mother is both Widow, Maid, and Wife.
The Oracle speaks Treason, and Apollo's Priests
Are all Impostors—
Are we all safe? Are we not all consumed?
Bellarmo's stricken dead.
He's in a trance, O chafe his Temples!
Ye stand too close, Bear back, &amp; give him air.
Palladius.
Bend him, O bend him forwards.
He's past recovery.
I feel no Pulse.
Her eyes are open.
Methinks I feel some breath.
Stand by.
Are they all dead Artesio?
All three as dead as earth.
O unexampled Justice! Who can stand
Before the power of great Apollo's hand?
Augusta, let's away; Our flight may scope
Approaching after-claps: Augusta, come.
What, fallen asleep?
The Queen is in a Trance.
Augusta.
Heaven bless the Queen.
She stirs not.
She breathes not.
Make room, Stand farther off.
O she is dead, Is any hope of life?
Sir none at all.
Augusta, dear Augusta, speak,
Move but a finger: O she's past all cure!
But whore's her Crown?
Look here, upon Kettreena's head.
How came it thither?
Most Royal Sir, How this Crown came here
I cannot tell: Excuse me gracious Prince,
Who humbly lay it at your sacred feet.
Kettreena, keep it for us; keep it safe,
Till we require it, and dispose thereof.
Apollo's will must be, who give us patience
To bear his punishments: Take up the dead,
And let us see them all bestowed, and laid
In the sad Clofets of eternal rest.
Would may never swear if I had not rather
ferve the great Turk in his Galleys, then a Court Lady
in her humours.
Sirrah, how the poor wenches trembled when
we made them stay tother pint. But is my Lady so strict
Frank?
O she's a pestilent vixen when she's angry, and
as proud as Lucifer. She has been to me knowledge a
whole hour by the Houre-glasse making Faces in a
Looking-glasse. Sometimes putting out the nether
lip, sometimes bridling in the chin; sometimes
forming of a smile, sometimes figging up her
cheeks, sometimes kissing of her white hand, sometimes
practising a new French Curtsy. And then Cis must be
called, and then her Ladyships hair must be crisped, and
then her Ladyships face must be complexioned, and then
her Ladyships teeth must be scaled, and then her Lady∣ships
brows must be mullited, and then her Ladyships
Turkie-egge must be eaten with a good grace. And then
her Ladyships foisting dog must be combed, and then Cis
must be sent for this dressing, and for that petticoat, and
Madge must be employed for that plain Hankercher,
and then for that purled Gorget which Cis was filling all
last night. Then fault must be found, then Cis must be
chidden, and Madge must be rated: And her sullen La∣diship
must keep her chamber all day, and at night her
peevish Ladyship must be sick and go to rest. Then at
Midnight Cis must be called to kill the Flea that keeps her
Ladyship from sleeping forsooth. Then Cis must slip on
her petticoat to see if the Hall-doore be shut, then down
again to rate the dogs, then down again to fetch her
Ladyship some Beer. Then Cis must look under the
Bed; after that into the Closer, to see if there be ne'er a
Cat to break her Ladyships Glasses. Insomuch that I
hold it the greatest misery in the world, next being a
Lady, to be a Chambermaid. But I must away. Tony,
farewell.
Nay Frank, we'll have one sresh pint to drink
Madge and Cis's Healths before we part. 
Anon, anon, presently, presently.
But Tony, Tony, Tony, let it alone, for tic Hawk∣ing
time; My Hawk has been empty pannel'd these three
hours.
I come, I come, presently, presently.
Hang Hawks, we'll have one pint.
By and by, By and by, I come I come.
Prithee Tony be nimble then.
Now had I as lief go a hanging as a hawking—
Whatsoere the matter is, I ha'no mind to that sport.
Id rather have Cis in my arms, then a leash a Partridges
in my poutch: Tic a feat Girl. O that this were my
marriage day! on that condition I went barefoot to bed.
Pretty Rogue! Well, I'm resolved, what ere come on it,
I will marry and I must marry, and I will marry ere
two days come to an end. Let my Lady get her a new
Falconer, or eat Mutton if she please. O Mutton, Mut∣ton,
Mutton! Well, I must marry, and I will marry;
To day I receive my wages, and to morrow Isle buy a
Licence, and next day Cis and Isle clap hands, And hey!
then up go we.
Here Frank, a Health to Cis.
Come, Isle pledge't, were it a mile to the boat∣tome. 
Now Tony, fill me a cup: A Health to Madge.
Come away: Madge shall never go unpledg'd
whilst I am worth a Pint, nor never want while I am
worth a penny.
Thou art grown wondrous kind to day, Tony.
I think the Moone's in the Hotti-totty, and all the
loving Planicles are in Conjunction. Sirrah, I am so
strangely taken within these two hours, that I ha'much
ado to keep my self honest.
Huts Wookers, I'm in the same Predicature
Tony. My Stars lend me honesty enough to light me to
bed, and keep Cis out of my way. But tell me, how li∣kissed
thou Cis?
Hougely well I perrest. As I live, tic a dainty
Girl: She speaks so wisely and her words are so well
placed, and she lisps so prettily, and so thweetely, And
sirrah they say that lithping wenches are good to kith.
Now tell me thy opinion of Madge.
I tell thee Tony, she's as good a creature as ever
lived in a house, and as well beloved of the servants. Thou
shalt have a dainty huswife, and an excellent Starcher,
and one that my Master respects above all the rest. If his
Band be to be pinned, no body can please him but Madge;
When his Corns are to be cut, none must do it but
Madge. If his Cuffe-strings are to be tied, none can tie
'em but Madge. When his Muskadine and Eggs are to
be prepared, none can please him but Madge: When his
head aches, Madge must hold it: If his back itch, Madge
must scratch it: And to her credit be it spoken, he
swears, for a Foot, and a Leg, and a dainty black eye,
and a white smooth skin, and a—
No more good Frank, thou make me mad.
My Stars lend me but honesty enough till I have oppor∣tunity
to lose it.
And me but patience till Thursday.
Why Thursday?
If I breathe, Cis and Isle have a marriage day
ont.
Say thou me so? Art in carnest? Give me thy
hand.
I, as sure as this is flesh, and blood, &amp; knuckles.
If Madge and I don't the like (if she be as
willing as I) hang Tony. But shall's marry in our old
Clothes?
Huts diggers, I'd not stay till Friday for the
Kings Wardrobe.
A match then! Give me thy clutch, Bring them
bither a Thursday morning, by break a day, and we'll
dispatch the business before the Crow peace.
Now Frank, here's a Health to the happy day.
Let it come, boy.
Here's another to the happy night.
Come away.
Anon, anon, presently, presently.
Farewell Frank.
Tony farewell, and remember—
Very very welcome, Gentlemen.
A pint a Canary in the Lyon, Skore!
I cannot rest, Artesio, till I purge
This groaning Land of Pertenax his blood.
See, here the Prisoners.
Mercy, O mercy, gracious Prince.
Mercy, dread Sovereign, mercy.
Wretches; The way to Mercy, is Confession.
Speak truth, Are ye guilty of this murder?
Most gracious Prince, I was no Actor in it.
Nor I Contriver, may it please your grace.
No, She contrived, and He acted it.
Speak, is it so? Come speak the truth.
True gracious Sovereign, but we hope for
mercy from your gracious hands.
Say, what Confederates had ye?
May it please your Grace, Lactusia set me on.
Trippit first called me in.
She has her punishment: Who writ the Letter?
The Queen, most Royal Sir.
Who promised on her Royal faith to stand
twixt me and danger. Sir, for her dear sake be gracious,
O marble hearts, to plot so vile a fact
Against such Dove-like Innocence as this.
Well, take them hence, and see due Justice done
According to our Laws, whereof we charge
A present Execution.
Mercy, O Mercy. Tic the first offence.
Be gracious to us. Mercy, mercy.
Officers, Away with them.
Since Heaven hath pleased to deprive us thus
Of our dear Consort, our beloved Queen,
We think it fit, to let our people know
That we have made a second choice, to cafe
The weighty Burden of our careful Crown.
Kettreena, bring the Crown.
And for thy pains,
We here accept thee for our lawful Spouse,
To be our Consort in Augusta's stead:
In pledge whereof we crown thy Royal head.
Dost thou consent Kettreena?
Be pleased most Royal Sir to
Give me leave to disburden my conscience of a secret
that concerns the State.
Speak on.
Sir, Augusta was no lawful Queen.
The woman's mad.
Away with her.
Good Sir be pleased to hear me out.
Speak on, speak on.
Kettreena was the lawful Queen, whom new∣lie
borne, I then her Nurse, exchanged for Augusta your
late wife, who was no other but Artesio's daughter.
Enticed by him I did it, unto which
He did corrupt me with a great reward.
That this is truth, I seal it with my blood.
Artesio, is it not so?
Artesio speak. What say to this?
Sir I'm a dying man, if not by Law, by age.
I, whom my frozen blood denies to blush,
Must not be bold to lye.
I'm likely to have a fine pull of this.
Lactusia speaks but truth: The Act's confessed.
Are my hopes come to this?
My life or death lies in Kettreena's breast.
Officers conduct the Prisoners back, and stay
Their execution till you farther hear:
If this be so, Evaldus must resign
Both place and Crown,
And now an humble Subject join
With all the rest, and say, LONG LIVE
OUR QUEEN KETTREENA.
And now Mucous may go hang himself.
Being thus ordained by heavenly powers to wear
The secret Crown of unexpected Care;
And well advising, what great danger waits
Upon the Scepters of ungoverned States:
Conscious of too much weakness to command
So great a Kingdom with a single hand:
W'are pleased to choose a Consort, in whose care
The Realm hath prospered, and to whom we dare
Commit our self and it.
Evaldus, to requite thy charge, we choose
Thee our dear Husband, and with sacred vows
We make thee partner in our unknown bed,
And set this Crown Imperial on thy head.
And let the tongues of our good Subjects ring
Loud peals of joy,
LONG LIVE EVALDUS KING.
Two Crowns have blessed Evaldus in one hour.
This crowns my heart with joy:
This crowns my head with power.
Fair Queen, Artesio's punishment we leave
To thy dispose.
The personal offence we freely pardon;
But for the public wrong, we must confine him.
And left that after-Ages
Should interrupt the right of true succession,
We charge Mucous to the self-same place:
Where they shall want for nothing, but enjoy
(Excepting Freedom) their own hearts desires.
Mean while, what Art, and Industry can doe
T'expresse our joys, and Subjects full content,
Let not be wanting: Let us bend our care
T'advance a public mirth, and to prepare
Such Triumphs, whose bright Honour might display
A panick joy, and glorify the day
Of Marriage-Royall, solemnised between
New-crown'd Evaldus, and his Royal Queen.

O Yes, O yes, O yes; here is a golden Crown, worth many a hundred Pound; twill fit the head of a Fool, Knave, or Clown; it was lately taken from the Royal Head, of a King Martyred; Who bids most? Here is a Sceptre for to sway a king∣doom a new reformed way; it was usu•p'd from one we did lately betray; pray Customers come away: Here be Jewels of won∣dross price, they will dazzle both your eyes; come, come, who buys: here be suits of the Kings, Bands, Shirts and Shoo-strings; Here be S ockings; here be shoes and cuffs, and double dou∣ble Ruffs; here be cloaks, hats and gloves, Rings and Bracelets
of His Dear Loves; Here be boots and spurs, and bloody hand∣kerchers; with his Robes that be royal, his Watch &amp; Sun-diall; Here be Cabinets with Letters, to instruct all your betters; his Meditations and Prayer-book, in which all Nations may look; here is his Hair and royal Blood, shed for his Subjects good; here be Liberaries and Books, and Pictures that contain his Looks; Here you may all things buy, that belong to Monarchy; Here's a Bowl his blood to Carouse with the Goods belonging to his House; here be rich Hangings, Chairs and Stools, belonging to the House of Lordly Fools; here be seats of Wool-packs, and many pretty Knacks. Come customers buy, for the STATE wants money, my Candle is light, and I shut up before night.
GEntlemen, welcome to New-Market-Fayre; Here are Commodities worth your Purchasing; the spoils of Tyrant Kings, and of incestious Queens▪ which We have crushed by power of Arms; and made them taste Our high Displeasure at large, when Victory was proud to honour Us at Nasbys happy Field. I hope you'll give me leave to choose what I like best.
My Lord, the Fair is proclaimed, and Free: you have no greater privilege then the meanest here; our Interest's all a∣like in every parcel.
What want ye Gentlemen? here's Stately Ware; The Goods of the King, and his Exiled Heir.
Where is the Crown that Col. Martin took from the Abbey at Westminster, some four years since? I think it fits my Temples, and i• the richest save one, an• that the Rebel Earl of Derby hath in the Isle of Man.
Here it is Sir; try it on: So, now it is sure,
And makes you look more like a King then Brewer.
It is most my •ight, and best becomes my head.
Not yet my Lord, till OLIVER be dead.
Better to Straight, then to have none at all,
Were it but on,— yours should quickly fall?
Here's a hundred pound in gold for it;
And here's the Purse was given me by a Citt.
A hundred pound bid for the royal Crown of England; who bids any more?
Here it is treble.
Three hundred pound bid for the royal Crown of England; who bids more?
Isle hav't in spite of Fairfax or Fate,
Although I buy't at ne'er so dear a rate:
Here's five hundred pounds; and now it is mine.
But not so hasty sir; Here's a thousand for it:
And more; because Isle make it sure,
Isle give thee in my Basin and my Ur.
I cause the Owner of it loose his head,
And shall I loose his Crown now he is dead?
No: Did it encompass the powrful brows of JOVE,
I'd storm the Heavens, and fetch it from above.
Are you content to share it then?
No: A Crown admits no Rival; Isle all or none,
He sits unsafe that doth divide his Throne.
Isle try that presently.
Doe if thou dare;
Run thy Blade in a Woman, doe,
Thou white. levered Knave thou; thou art marked for a Rogue;
Wooed I were a man for thy sake. Uds. foot Id—
What wooed ye Mistress Yest and Grains; marry foh— Come up Small-beer: You'd make your nose as red-hot as your husbands, and thrust it into his Fizzling-place, wooed ye not, Mistress Brazen-face.
Call me Mistress brazen-face;—; thou Rotter-dam slut thou;— call me brazen-faced. Thou look more liker a Mistress fools-face, or like thy Husbands-face, then I do a brazen-faced, or a copper-face either; Come, come; I never had a Bastard by another man, when my Husband was at the Leaguer before Breda; nor I keep not c•mpany with Cavaliers at Taverns; nay at Bawdy Taverns too, when thy Tom Innocent has been in fight. Gorge me that, Gorge me that Madam Turn-tayle.
You'll peace you Shee-Otter, Isle make ye take your Cop∣per else; and for Dives-face thy husband, Isle deal well enough with him —come fire-snowt, draw.
Nay, good my Lord, put up your sword; we shall ere long I fear have occasion enough to use your Valour: Fie, fie, in your own Country? wrong your own Country? it is the way to make us loose all we have got and fetch the Prince in amongst us: Isle to the Counsel of State, and take up the business to all your contents Isle warrant ye; in the mean time you may equally divide the Houses and goods of the late King Queen and Prince amongst us; you two shall cast lots, which shall be King of Eng∣land, and which of Ireland C•m. Gen. Ireton Prince of Wales, my self Master of the horse, and clerk of your Majesties Jewels; Col. Pride wi•l be content with Oate-lands, Wood-stock, or Greenwich to brew in: Mr. Martin Lord Chamberlain; Keep∣er of your Concubines, or Gentleman-Usher to one of your Queens; your Wives may enjoy all the Queens rights; and Ma∣jor Skippon be made Lord High Constable of England; Mr. Good∣win Archbishop o• Canterbury, Mr. Owen Archbishop of York, and Hugh Peters of London, Iohn Bradshaw Lord Chief Justice, Steel, R•lls, &amp;c. of the privy Counsel, •embroke Controller; Den∣b•igh Yeoman of the Wine-seller. •lemming Master-Cook, Sell∣den Secretary of State, my Lady Kent Laundress, Miles Corbet Scullion; and then we shall have a Kingdom well governed, and all the People contented to the full: Is not this better then fighting and weakening your selves to strenthen the Enemy?
Come come, let's be all Peace, and cease base jars,
Wee look for foreign, not domestic Wars.
Content, content; all is Peace, all is Peace.
But think ye that WE can brook any thing that was the late Queens; No she was a Strumpet, &amp; a Baggage, and all her Goods smell of Popety, and savor as strong as the Whore of babylon; If the Kingdom will not be at the Charge to find me all things New, by my troth, I will not be their Queen. Doe ye think that Isle be Odious to my People? No; they shall be proud of the Ornaments I wear.
The Gods themselves shall for my Love implore,
My People (eke some Goddess) me adore.
Be but content, my Dear, the glory of the world is thine.
Thou hast both Indies at thy beck; Thy train
Shall be held up by Queens of France and Spain
O Yes, O yes, O yes, Who buys any of the late Kings Revenues belonging to His Crown, worth many a hundred Thousand pounds; Here be Manors, Parks, Forests and Chases, and good Timber trees that grow on their places; Here be good store of Deer, for the Saints to make good cheer, and grown Woods for their feer; Here's Camels, Asses, and H•rses, that will mount you more Forces; Here be broken Seals Maces, and Members with hollow hearts, and double faces; Here's Dean• and Chapters Lands, and Parliament men with bloody hands; Here are perjured Knaves and Fools, that have •ndone Churches and Free-Schools; here's Grafton &amp; Bel-cause, •hat intend to steal half; Tony Mildmay and Lampier are entrust∣•d to sell Deer; here is Taxes of Gold-smiths-hall, Cozening, Cheating, Lying and the Devil and all; here is a new Art of doubling come in fashion, but hereafter twill prove double Dam∣nation; Ireton Reports the amendments of the Act, but you may one day see him hanged for the Fact; these holy thieves live only by murder and stealth, rob God, King and People for the good of the Common-wealth; here is Richmond and Hampton-Court, and Windsor-Castle, and Hovering for their sport; here's Wansted for Iudas Mildmay that with a kiss did his Master betray; here's Holmby a prison to relieves, and White-hall full of thieves; here's the Wardrobe intended for the poor, and St. Ianses that shrouds many a Parliament-mans whore; here is Titbury, Roy∣sto•• and Newmarket, to be sold out-right, or to be let; here's Cla∣ringdon, Oatlands, Theobalds, Woodstock, &amp; 400 l. per an. for my Lord fool-Pembrook there's Bushy; Greenwich and Sumerset-house, which will serve the Saints to inherit, and multiply their spirit; besides here be Offices and G•atuetyes, given for their brethrens lies; each Parliament-man has 4 l. per week allowed him: besides the Revenue, which they think is their due. Delinquents Estates and Church-lands, are all in State-hucksters hands, yet still they be poor, and tax the people more and more; the Self-denying-Or∣dinance, lies in a trance; the war is unjust, grounded on covetous∣nos
and lust. Come Customers and buy — your own slave•
I have laid out large Sums in purchasing of Bishops Lands; heaven send me comfort of them, and grant I may en∣joy them quietly. This news from Sea, and the Scots does not please me I promi•e ye.
I have purchased some too, and have money in readi∣nos for more. Sister Rain•brough you will have double share for the loss of your deer husband; enough to marry you to a Lord.
Indeed the State is liberal.
I, so they are of that that is none of their own.
WE must be sudden in our resolutions, ell's lost else; Money is a moveable Comm ditty, let's demand a million of the City: hang um, they are rich enough.
Do ye hear that brethren?
Tell them of Manors, Bishops, Deans, and Chapters Lands; it is the way to make the Jou • heads untrue•s —
Isle do it in my Breeches first.
But what if they deny us the money?
My Lord, I am confident they dare not: if they should, we can compel them: Here's an ill scent my Lord, pray let's void the room.
Some hasty news—pray heaven it is good.
Here's Letters for the General.
We're all undone; our Navy's lost at Sea; Dublin's ta∣ken; the Prince is landed with 30000 in the West; the Scots are advanced with five &amp; twenty Thousand to Carissle; the Levellers and Pre•bitters fly to them; and which is worse, the People ge∣nerally do our late Actions curse. We all are lost.
Ha, ha, ha; then you had best all hang your selves.
All People here behold our miseries,
Who lives by Treason, thus by Treason dies.

Hark boys? they sound us a retreat? this skirmish (sirs)
Was no rare pastime to conti∣nu at;
It is saffer wrestling in a bed; give me
Hence-forth your white faced foe, a plump fair enemy
That wears her head piece laced; I'm for a cambric helmet, I.
And yet these mighty men of Millain got
But little by the sport; some of them shall
Vouchsafe to wear a single arm hereafter,
Two wooden legs too, and limp their days out
In an Hospital.
How? an Hospital?
A rode, a rode; your highway sir is now
Your only walk of state for your maimed soldier.
Your Hospitals and pensions are reserved
For your maimed Mercer, decayed sons of the shop,
That have been often cracked not in their crowns
Like us, but in their credit sir.
And placket squires, that have bin long diseased
In their Lords service; a score of ducats
Shall bribe them into place, where they may sleep,
And eat, and pray too, but with breath so much
Vnholsome, the air can hardly purify't
And make it fit to reach near heaven.
Well, the surprise of the citadel, wherein
The Duke had placed his daughter, with the Ladies
Of her train, and treasure too, was a service
Of most rare work.
Just when they sallied out
To cut our Rear in pieces, then steal in
By Ambush wisely laid, and make them all
Our prize, was miracle.
They say his daughter escaped, and fled, with her
As her best guard, one they call Lionel
Whom our Count Prospero pursued.
Welcome; is all our pillage waggond
Shall it to night see Turin?
Alls safe my lusty leader; our horse too
Have sounded a retreat; and the foe sneaks▪
He walks wed's hands in's pockets like a skipper
In a frost.
Well, let me reckon my estate;
First a widow prisoner.
Mine's a maid prisoner,
Young my Vasco, she's yet in her first blush,
And I've dispatched her unto Turn too
My Mothers house, thy prisoner in her com∣pany,
They are acquainted.
You have the luck; these bald chins are as familiar
With their good stars, as with spur-rowells,
Play with them, and turn'em which way they please;
I fought as well as he; and yet (forsooth)
His prisoner must be fair, and young, &amp; mine
So old she might have given Hercules suck,
Now she sucks too, for she hath no teeth left,
In one month she'll cost me as much in caw∣dles
And sweet candy, as her ransom comes too.
But you have other pillage Captain.
Let me see, 3 Barbary horses with rich
Caparisons, 2 Chests of the Generals cloths.
And I 2 chests of the Generals plate.
In those I share Altesto.
How? plate? shall we encounter our sowe'd fish
And broyld Pullen in silver service rogues?
Like furred Magnificoes?
We shall Captain, but you may dip your morsel in good china earth.
All your plate Uasce, is the silver handle
Of your old prisoners franne.
Here comes Prospero the valiant Count.
And with him the brave prize.
Evandra do not morn, I that have made
You captive thus with hazard of my youth
And blood, shall think you now as worthy of
My care, as of my volour in the fight;
Can I esteem you less by being mine?
What have I done (unknown unto my heart)
That I should tempt your valour to so great
A 〈◊〉 as my captivity? or are my crimes
Observed more than my prayers, that hey∣ven shall leave
Me to become the scorn of victory?
It is the sad pre-eminence of your
Exemplar birth, and beauty, to confer
Honour on him that is your conqueror.
Honour? is that the word that hath so long
Betrayed the Emulous world, and foold the noblest race
Of men, into a vexed and angry death?
If it were a virtue it would not strive t'in∣thrall,
And thus distress the innocent.
I am the wars disciple, and since first
I had the growth to wear a sword, I ne'er
Was taught how to subdue by reason but
By strength. Altesto?
My Lord.
Take here this Lady to your charge, conduct
Her unto Turin, and there guard her in
My house till my approach.
I shall my Lord.
Let her be safe Altesto in thy care
On forfeiture of life, she is my prisoner
And the noblest in the field, the beauteous
Heir of Millaine; had not my niggard stars
Intended me but half a curtsy,
The Duke her Father had lamented now
Under the same fate.
I could wish your Lordship would believe me,
A fitter man, to take charge of the Lady.
Why Captain?
You could not commit her to an Eunuch
With more safety; if the great Turk knew me
(Honest Achmet) he would trust me in's Se∣raglio
(By this hand) without defalking one grain beneath the waste.
Success hath made you wanton Cap.
Besides (my Lord) I have tan an old Abesse
Prisoner, O such a Governess for a
Young maid, sheel read to her such ho∣miles,
And teach her such receipts out of the Fa∣theirs,
How to cure the toothache, preserve plumms,
And boyle Amber posits, will make her sir
In three days a very St.
Well you shall take my bounty too close by
The valley that doth join to the neighbour grove
Lies conquered by my sword a Millain knight,
His wounds medcin'd, &amp; stopped by the best art
I had, but by much loss of blood unable yet
To move, him, and his ransom I bestow on you,
I thank your Lordship
But use him nobly Uasco; for he hard
A courage that well merited his cause,
And fought with eager and with ssillfull, strength
To free that lady from my bonds, but the glad day was mine.
He shall be kindly used,
Only your sweet lordship must give me leave
When he poi's his ransom to weigh his gold,
Were he my father, sir, he must endure
The trial of my scales; follow Tristan.
Make haste; see him well waggond, and provide
A surgeon to attend his cure.
Sir, can you find no pity yet within
Your breast? you have already shown e∣nough.
Of your sterne fathers spirit, is there not
In all your heart so much of softness as
Declares you had a mother too, must I
Be led a captive, land in a cruel land
Lament your victory?
Altesto, be are her from my sight? make haste?
I am not safe, when I converse with tears.
I would ambition were not brave in war?
Or that the rage of Princes had not made
It lawful to subdue whom they dislike,
Or it were ignoble to inflict a misery,
As to endured our selves; Frivolo, where
Did thou leave the prince?
In pursuit of the Duke, who since we hear
Recovered Millaine, which causs'd him sound us.
A retreat,—hark sir, his march leads hither;
It is his way to Turin.
The prince, the prince; my Lord Prospero
You have been sought for, the valiant prince
For this day's action hath advunt'd you to
The public ear, and we your friends re∣joyc'd.
I did but as his bold example gave
Me fire; I saw him conquer kill, and lead
In fetters sad Faces, which I 〈…〉
Before, and I believed it was good; I wish
That heaven may think so too; I do con∣verse
With books, but I have heard our enemies
(Although they wronged not me) must be so used.
Unbuckle Calladine, the day is hot,
And our great business cools like to their heats,
That fled to humbled Millaine, &amp; have lest
Their fainting honour hovering over our crests,
Lead on my horse in triumph; I will march
On foot, he hath performed his work, as he
Had equalled me in sense of what he did.
Sir, Prospero the Count, whom your kind fears
So heartily inquired for in the retreat
Pass noble youth, and let me hold thee near
My heart, join thy stout breast to mine that we
May grow a while together in our love,
Yet when divided, be the same in thought
And act, this day then hast begot an history,
And given our Savoy Chronicles a theme
To teach them boast, and be believed
Alvaro? my dread Prince; why should you lose
Your praise on me, that did but imitate
The faintest of your vigour, and your skill?
You bred me from my childhood to doe things
That they call glorious, though (dull and much unlearnt)
I cannot teach the cause of what I doe,
More than your example, and command.
Since thou got strength to wear a sword, thou hast
Been mine, and it had been drawn to execute
My will, and though (I know not why) thou wast
A verse to arts, and written labours of
The wise, yet discipline of war thou lov'dsts
And bring thee to a 〈◊〉 steed, him thou
VVouldst sit, and manage with such gentle rule
That our Idolatrous Philosophers
Believed thou had created, whom thou I caught'st
Your love will breed me envy sir; something.
I've done (since you are pleased to value so
My weaker toils) which may perhaps de∣serve
Your fathers thanks, and yours, and's yet un∣known
Unto you both, Evandra, heir of Millaine,
I have sought for, tan prisoner, and sent
To Turin, a reward for our just war.
Ho! the fair Evandra made pri∣sooner?
And Prospero by hee?
Why should you think him whom you praised
So much, unfit for such a victory.
Now all the blessings of my faithful love
Are lost; she whom I doted on with my
Most chaste, and early appetite, is sent
In bonds, t'apease my cruel fathers wrath.
My Lord, he loved her much though temp'rately
Concealed from general knowledge, and his friends.
Then mount my courser Frivolo, and try
If by the happy quickness of his speed,
Thou can recover her return, and use
Her with such fair respective homage as
May expiate my violent surprise.
Fly, fly; I would thy nimble motion could
Oretake the arrow from the Assyrian bow,
Or swifter lightning whom our fight pursues
And is to slow to reach.
What have I done, that I should thus mistake
An act of valiant glory, for a deed
That argues an austere Ignoble rage?
Fair Evandra, the pied of Italy,
In whom the Graces met to rectify
Themselves, that had not cause enough to blush
Unless for pity they were not so good
As she; think now the Eastern spices sweet,
And that the blossoms of the spring perfume
The morning ayre; necessity must rule
Belief, lets strew our Altars with them now,
Since she's imprisoned, stifled, and choked up
Like weeping Roses in a still, whose Inar∣ticulate breath
Heaven through a purer sacrifice than all our orisons.
Is she not fitter then
For Turin, than for Millaine sir? I saw
You take prisoners, and in my fury had
Discretion to achieve the best.
O thou hast lost my heart; hence doth proceed
This recreant act, that to thy savage courage
I could never join the temperature
Of sweet Philosophy; had thou been learned,
And read the noble deeds of gentle knights,
Reason had checked thy rage, thy valour would
Have been more pitiful than to have lead
A virgin into harsh captivity.
I thought I had done well.
How! well? draw back that falsehood in thy breath
Again, or I will pierce thy heart, that thou.
May dye Impenitent.
Vnhand me Callandine, I've already met
My better thoughts; why should I waste my wrath
On such a forester? wild as the woods,
Where he should graze with the brute heard, who though they want
Discoursive soul, are less inhumane far than he.
She was the daughter of our greatest enemy,
And so I used her sir.
A choleric Bear; or hungry Pan∣there would
Have used her with more soft remorse; had I
Encountered her in the mad heate of chase,
In all the fury of the fight, I would
Have taught my angry steed the easy and
The peaceful motion of a lamb,
She should have set his back, soft as the ayre,
And in her girdle bridle him, more curbed
Than in his soaming bit, whilst I her slave,
Walked by, marking what hasty flowers sprung up,
Invited by her eye-beames from their cold roots;
And this would each true soldier do, that had
Refined his courage with the sober checks
Of sweet Philosophy.
Would you had taught me some Phi∣losophy
Before I learned to fight.
All hope is past; she was conveyed in one
Of your swift chariots sir, which it doth seem
Altesto did unhappily oretake,
And she's ere this within our Turned walls.
Such language and such news better become
The fatal birds of night, so Ravens croak
When they fly ore the mansions of the sick
And bode their deaths.
Prospero, see me no more,
You are a disease unto my injurd sight:
Fly to some lustful coast, where none but Goats
And Satyrs live, where the name of virgin is
As strange as this thy cruelty, there thou
May hope to wander not contemned, should I
Behold thy face again, and let thee live,
My patience would become my vildest guilt.
See, sir, he weeps; can you endure him morn
And languish thus, whom heretofore you did
Embrace in the chief ranek of love, not moved
(Sir) with his tears?
No more than to behold
The puddled channel overflow; he saw
Her weep, and could endured; the drops fell down
Me thinks, as when the piteous Pelican
Wounds her remorseful hreast.
Sir, have I in one hasty moment, so
Far merited my ruin that no means
Is left to win me to your former grace.
Never, unless thou could restore
Evandras liberty, she is ere this
Within my fathers reach, whose nature is
Severe, and mortal to her fathers blood,
An ancient vow he took, will make her de∣stine.
So sad, I fear to think on it, poor Evandra.
I sent her in good conduct to my house,
Where is a cave, so art fully cenceld
Within my gardens verge, that not the suns
Most prying beams, not humane search
Can ere discover it, He hide her there,
Till time and apt convenience can dispose
Her unto Millain.
Fly then, loose not the sick hope with slow
Pursuit, fate keep her from my father.
I• strive to groan away my breath, and die.
Hark sir, the Duke your father sure
Doth ride in triumph through the town, to meet
And celebrate your victory.
Give order that our troops march, march slowly on;
Our Drums should now in fable cases beat
Our colours soulded, and our Muskets be
Reversed, whilst our dejected pikes we trail,
But that I fear, t'would breed inquiry in
My father of a cause, he must not know,
O Callandine Evandra is in bonds.
Prepare the waggon Tristan, spread a matt in 't
And (dost here) bid my Ancient tear of's colours
For a coverlet, tic thine sir, all our shift?
Ell's ready sir, ith bottom of the hill,
He shall used like a Queen when she lies in.
Softly Tristan, he moves as weakly as
His sinews were of spinners threads, so cut
And carved; he hath made your skin, sir, only
Fit to be worn in summer; this Prospero
Is a Turk when's whinyards drawn, and shines in's eyes.
He used me nobly sir, when I had bled (could
My self past strength to conquer him, wee
I hope to find such mercy in an Enemy,
Less I had fallen beneath the force of your
Alvaro, Prince of Piemont.
I there's a man; tic true, Lord Pros. poro valiant,
I think he dares meet the devil in Duel,
And give him two flashs of lightning odds, but
He wants that they call learning sir, Prince Alvaro;
Is (as they say) a philosopey man:
He takes of Robins, and strange Hebrew roots;
Things we dull Soldiers hither learn then mention.
He can tell you sir how many show∣ers fell
Since Noahs flood.
I, and how many cloaks those showers have wet.
Have you no knowledge of the Lady sir
That was surprised from my protection by young Prospero?
Good; was ever creature of heavens making
So libidinous as paltry man? now
Has he a mind to the Lady? she sir,
Is safe in Turin, whither strait we mean
To lead you too.
Some comfort yet, it is decreed I must
Endure my bondage where she suffers her's,
Poor Evandra's was fater so niggardly
She could allow no more protection for
Thy beauty than my single fortitude?
Come move on sir, it will be late ere we
Shall reach the town.
What other for tune had the bat tail?
We swaddled your Duke home he and the rest
Of your bruised countrymen have wondrous need
Of capon's grease.
Strange giddiness of war; some men must groan
To further others mirth, what fury rules
Ore humane sense, that we should struggle to
Destroy in wounds, and rage, our life, that heaven
Decreed so short? in is a mystery
Too sad to be temembred by the wise,
That half mankind consume their noble blood,
In causes not beloved, or understood.
You have heard the proclaimed law Vasco.
I would there were no law, or that no man
Were learned enough to read em, or that we had
Courage enough not to obey them
Frivolo, what law is this?
It is proclaimed all female prisoners
After a year should have free liberty
To return to Millaine, and ransomless.
Only a year is given to us the conquerors,
That those we took of birth, and dowry may
(If we can woo them to consent) marry us,
But wee have no power to use constraint, nor to
Enforce a maidenhead, on pain of death.
My beldam hath tan order with her maidenhead
Ten years ere I was borne.
In the mean time Tristan,
As a requital for our hopes, we must
Maintain them at our own charge?
Must not the men wee took pay ransom?
Yes, yes, they pay: I have a Knight given me
By young Count Prospero shall sell his spurs
Ere he scope free, I will pawn him till he
Be worn to the title of a Squire.
Thou art as cruel as a Constable
That's waked with a quarrel out of his first sleep.
Hang him bold Caraian, hee indites finely;
And will live as well by sending short E∣pestles
Or by th'sad whisper at your gamsters elbow
When the great by is drawn, as any bashful
Gallant of em all.
But whats the cause our Duke is so severe
Unto the heir of Millain (whom it is said
Shall suffer instant death) yet is thus kind
To others of her sex.
She dies to satisfy
A vow hee made in's youth, when those of Millain
Took his brother prisoner, and would not be
Appeased without the for feiture of's head.
I am not yet instructed Frivolo,
Why should not then the rest we took die too?
Evandra is a sacrifice for all;
His other mercy takes from th'crueltie
He shows on her.
From whence Altesto comes your loftiness?
Why, from the Duke; I had laid me
For breakfast a fine comfortable gin.
What was it, a wench?
A rack Vasco, a rack;
A certain Instrument that will extend, and draw
Our sinews into treble strings, and stretch
Our great shin bones, till they become slender
As knitting needles, or a Spiders legs.
Did thou commit Treason? it is well thou hast
A brain for any thing, the age requires
Parts, we cannot eat else; but quick, the cause.
It was to discover where I left Evandra,
Whom Prospero delivered to my charge;
I answered a full truth, that I restored
Her to his hands, at his return to's house,
And this (as fortune would vouchsafe) the Duke
Believed without applying (Gentlemen)
The recreation of the rack.
But she is not yet found.
No, and the Duke believes her still In the Town.
Therefore a guard is placed at all the gates to hinder her escape.
I do not like
This cutting off young wenches heads; it is thought
They cannot kiss handsomely without them.
But how does Prospero excuse her flight?
He says she's stolen away, but shows no manner how;
And the angry Duke, though he be precious in
His love, threatens him much.
Some Angel stole her from him, and Gentlemen
If I have any skill in Magic you
Shall see her three days hence perking in a Cloud,
Southward of yonder Star; look up, just there;
With her Ivory Lute hanging at her back,
And working me a scarf of sky-colour'd Satin.
A halter (Vasco) to save the poor State
The charge of a penny, thou'lt have need on it.
What's become of Melora, your fair prisoner?
You hear the Proclamation.
Yes, and am well pleased, I mean to woo, and marry her, she hath
Twelve thousand crowns by good intelli∣gence.
If she consent; but I am of the faith,
Such Suckets are but seldom swallowed by
Us wealthy Aldermen of the Camp; a join∣ture
Is the word Altesto, and then you'll show her
A young back with a Sword hanging over't,
Worse than a handsaw.
Just now I left her at my mothers house;
And sir Vasco, she looks, oh rogue, rogue!
A Flanders peak in the middle of her brow,
Which straight I spy, and shake, and melt, then speak
Fine language to her, and am duteous with
My Bonnet at her Instep thus—
You have sound the way.
Then Vasco she moves back, disco∣vering but
The very verge of both her picked toes,
But in white Shoes, and then I'm taken that
I stand like one of the Turks chidden mutes,
A girl in a Bongrace thus high may ravish me.
Alas poor Gentleman!
But Vasco, her fiugers, by this good day,
I think they are smaller than thy point tags,
And she behaves them on the Virgins
So prettily, I'd wish no more of he ven,
Than once to hear her play Fortune my Foe:
Or John come kiss me now.
Those are tunes my old widow pri∣sooner sings
With more division than a water work
When the maine pipe is half stopped.
You have a year allowed to woo her Vasco.
She's rich; I knew her husband, he thrived much
By a monopoly he had of dead women's hair,
All Millaine talked of it; she kept another shop
Under St Maudlins wall, and quilted ushers Calves.
Well Gentlemen, let's waste no time, I'll to
My Barbers straight, purge, shave, and wash, for know
If cleanenesse and good looks will do it Isle teach
Her Grandameship to mump, and marry too,
Or my arts fail; Frivolo, you and Tristan
Follow me, I shall employ you both.
I am for Prospero, he sent to speak with me.
Sir, you have made me know my cruelty,
It was such incomely valour, that I blush
To name't, and trust me, could I sink low as
The Center whilst I kneel, still would I thus
Implore your pardon, and your love. Kneels
Arise, I have a memory so apt
T'advance my pity 'bove my anger when
It mentions thee, that Isle forget the cause
That made thy guilt, and me to morn; but O,
This dismal place brings it again to thought,
This looks methinks like to the dark
And hidden dwelling of the winds, as yet
Unknown to men, where storms engender, and
The whirling blasts that trouble Nature till
She tremble at their force, and ruin all
The sumptuous piles of Art.
Necessity hath cause this choice, till the
Severe inquiry of your Father be
Appeased, and we can shape her a disguise fit to
Convey her from the Town.
With soft and gentle summons call, that she
May clime unto the top, and verge of the cave.
Evandra speak, ascend to us; I am
Your penitential Enemy, that come
To weep away my trespass at your feet.
Evandra, rise, break from this thick
And silent darkness, like the eldest light.
Ha! my Lord the Prince?
O noble mind, what expiation can
Make fit this young and cruel Soldier for
Society of men, that hath deferred
The Genius of triumphant glorious war
With such a rape upon thy I bertie?
Or what less hard than marble of
The Parian Rock, can thou believe my heart,
That nursed and bred him my Disciple in
The Camp, and yet could teach his valour no
More tenderness than injured Scythians use
When they are vexed to a revenge? but he
Hath mourned for it, and sure Evandra thou
Art strangely pitiful, that dost so long
Conceal an anger that would kill us both.
Sir, I am nobly recompensed, in that
You will vouchsafe me worthy of your grief,
And though I dye forgotten here (a poor
And luckless maid) lost like a blossom which
The injurious wind buries in dust, yet so
Much curtsy deserves to be remembered even in heaven.
Was this a subject fit to bear the pride
And insolent calamity of war?
As well had it become in the worlds youth
The Giant Race, to hunt with mighty spear
And iron shield, the soft and tender Ermine;
Evandra, I have loved thee much, and long.
Why dost thou start, as if some jealous thought
Did whisper that my love devised this snare
To keep thee here within my power and reach?
I cannot think you are so cruel to
Your self, to afflict the thing that you esteem.
No beauteous maid, had I behold thy flight
In our sterne exercise of wrath, I would
Have made the bloody field a garden fit
In adorn the shows of a triumphant peace;
And every soldier like a reaper clothed,
Fitter to use his sickle than his sword.
Still thou recoyl'st like the chaste Indian plant, at the
That shrinks and curls his bashful leaves,
Approach of man.
I've lost my reason, and I want the courage
To entertain you kindness as I ought.
Is it because my years a little have
Oregrowne my youth, or that the enmity
Our Fathers interchange begets in thee
A factious hate, till't make thy duty sin?
But tic not possible thou can create
A thought will merit such a name.
The gentle business sir of love is fit
For hours more calm, and blessed than those
A captive can enjoy.
These are not words
To quiet me in sleep, &amp; peaceful thoughts.
Nor shall I evermore relish delights
And triumphs of the court, or haughty joys
Of war and victory.
Evanara live, be yet some happi∣ness
Unto thy self, and with the patience that
Becomes a maids divinity, relieve
Thy heart with easy hope of liberty,
Enforcing a content within this dark
And solitary cave, till I have power
With apt disguise to further thy escape,
Which shall be hastened with my ablest skill.
Believe me good Evandra, the honour of
My birth and soul shall warrant it.
You are a Prince renound, and precious for
Your faith, and curtsy.
Think not Isle use advantage, or constraint
Upon thy love, a virgins heart (I know)
Is sooner stroked than checked into a kind
Surrender of her breast.
Sir, all the bounties that the hey∣vans provide
For truth and clemency, fall on your still.
If thou suspect'st I've not enough of cold
And holy temper to resist the flames
Of appetite, command that I shall see
Thee here no more, &amp; my obedience strait
Shall be restraind within a sacred vow,
For I would have thy thoughts (Evandra) safe
As thy beauties are.
It were a crime
Greater (I hope) than I shall ere commit
To doubt such princely goodness can per∣vert it self.
Then I shall cherish opportunities
To hasten my return.
Not Angels sure when they con∣verse, can meet
With less intent of sin, and more of joy?
Well, I must see thee oft, thy won∣dross eyes
Have softened all my spirits to a calm
And easy temper for thy sway, that I
Could change my corslet, and my iron vests
Of rugged war, to move in gentle pace,
Unto the tuneful whispers of thy Lute,
Still clothed in tender garments of thy work,
And for a plumed Helmet wear chaplets
Of flowers, in a mysterious order ranked
By thy white virgin hand, thou like thy neat
Ore'busie maid, bind up thy looser philetting,
And pleate in curls thy soft dishevelld hair.
Isle make my frequent visits here till thou
Confess how much I am subdued.
I am oppressed with fear, the watch∣full Duke
Your father should observe, unto this sad
Unusual place, your stolen approach, &amp; then
My sorrows would be doubled in your dan∣ger.
Danger? how noble lovers smile at (such
A thought? it is love that only fortifies
And gives us mighty vigour to attempt
On others force, and suffer more than we
Inflict; would all the soldiers that I lead
In active war, were lovers too, though lean,
Feebled, &amp; weakened with theit ladies frowns;
How when their valours stirred, would they march strong,
Through hideous gulphs, through numerous herds
Of angry Lyons, and consuming fire?
What doubtful noise is that?
It is Colladine, I did appoint him here.
Stay Prospero, let him not enter yet;
O envious chance, must we depart so scone?
Descend like the bright officer of day,
Whilst darkened we thy beauteous absence morn,
And every flower doth weep till thy re∣turn?
His looks declare there's hazard, and some haste.
What would thou? speak.
The Duke your father (sir) is much perplexed;
He calls for Prospero, and it is feared,
Will torture him to find Evandra's flight.
He shall not yet appear; I will in∣dure
His angers edge with venture of my self.
Stay till I send.
My Lord, I grieve to see your sor∣rows bear
So great a weight, as makes you groan unto
Your self; this silence, and fixation of
Your eyes, until unchanged objects cause
Them ache, is much unlike your wonted mind;
Suspect not but the Prince will qualify
His Father to a peace, and a more just
Interpretation of your worth.
Know Calladine, it is not Evandras bonds,
Nor all the torments that the incensed Duke
From cruelty or art can minister,
Have power to freeze, and fix me like a sty∣tu thus;
I have another cause that swells my heart,
Till 't grow too spacious for my breast.
Alas sir! your favours have obliged me so
That I must share your grief, and it would perhaps
Afferd some remedy to share the cause.
I know not Calladine in the vast world
One I more love, or would so boldly trust;
But thou wilt think me mad.
My Lord, Isle forget then my man∣ners, and
My reason too.
Come, thou shalt know, I love—
How wilt thou smile to seem ambitious eyes
Look higher than the Eagle, when he soars
To elevate his sight? I love—
Who is it you love?
Evandra; now mix pity in thy scorn.
It is sad the Prince and you should meet with so
Much violence in the same choice.
At first, in the rage of fight, I gazed on her,
With half discernings of her form, a mi••
Of fury hung between us then, but since
That I have viewed her beauty with some care,
And seen how sweetly she demeans her in
Calamity, I have orethrown my heart
With liking her too much.
It will require great wisdom to per∣swade
In this, the cause is dangerous.
Would I had ne'er been born, then I had missed
The sight and memory of her, and my
Fond errors should have been as much un∣known
As my uncreated self.
My Lord, your servant gave me en∣trance with
Command that I should speak with you.
It is true; Altesto you've a maiden prisoner,
Called Melora; it is my request that you
Conduct her hither in disguise; though law
Newly proclaimed, allow no ransom for her,
You shall be paid your own demand.
Isle obey your Lordship, she shall attend
You straight; what use can he employ her to?
Come Calladine, ease me with thy counsel.
Is Lily your own prisoner Tristan?
The powerful purchase of my sword.
What is she heir to? a brass thim∣ble, and
A skein of brown thread? she'll not yield thee in
Algiers above a ducats being stripped;
And for her clothes they are fitter for a paper∣mill
Than a Palace.
Let her serve your captive widow.
Why Tristan, that's a years wages for you;
It is well thought on; will you serve Lily?
I hope sir I shall be fit to serve.
Yes, serve for an Hospital, when the sins
Of the Camp are retired into your bones;
She's vilely out of Linen.
How can I helped?
Let her make love to a Sexton, and steal shrouds.
Trust my knowledge Vasco, she's for thy turn,
Present her to thy widow, she may woo
In thy behalf, toste plum cakes for her Mus∣kadine,
And brush her velvet hood on holy-dayes.
Tristan convey her to her as my gift;
But Lily you must speak notable words
Of me, first what a goodly man I am;
That I get Matrons at a hundred and ten
With double Twins, and how in time of war
I fill up the muster with mine own Issue.
Marry sir, heaven forbid.
Do you hear? this wench has been villainously
Ill bred; and Isle lay my life
She sings at her work too the holy carol
Of the Ladies daughter converted in Paris;
She was of Paris properly, &amp;c.
Fie Lily, you must now take care, you are
Not now in the Camp, but in a civil Common wealth.
I shall endeavour sir to learn.
Nor must you persuade you Mistress rise
Too early to her beads, she may catch cold,
Having already a pestilent cough,
And so will dye before I marry her.
I hope I shall not be so mischievous.
Well Gentlemen, the fruitful hour is now
Drawn near that gives success, this morn∣ing must
Expose me to great charge.
Thou dost not mean
To court her at her window with rare mu∣sick?
No, she's very deaf, so that cost is saved.
What other charge? she hath no teeth sit for
A dry banquet, and dancing she is past,
Unless with crutches in an Antimasque.
I must provide her Culleises, and Broths
That may stir metal in her, in this case
She is, know my good friends, I find
Her no more fit for the business of increase,
Than I am to be a Nun.
Thou wilt take care to trim thy person.
I came just now from consultation with
My Barber, who provides me a large maine,
A lock for the left side, so rarely hung
With Ribbanding of sundry colours sir,
Thou'lt take it for the Rainbow newly crisped
And trimmed, Bucephalus ne'er wore the like.
When you have reached Sir Leonels Ransom,
And the rich widows wealth, we are forgot,
Like creatures of Japan, things hardly to
Be searched for in the Map.
In one short month I shall not know his name.
It is then because thou can not read, for thou
Shalt find it fairly carved on each new Church
And Hospital, I mean to build apace,
And have my blew boys March through the streets
Two and two, provided for in gilded Primmers,
And their chops of mutton; go haste to the widows,
Present your Damsel, Isle be with you straight;
My captive Knight would speak with me.
I am bold sir to make free use of your
Most spacious rooms for benefit of air.
Sir you are welcome, it is a liberty
That I expect, and I joy much your wounds
So prosper in their cure.
You show your inclination kind and noble:
But is there of Evandra yet no news?
You promised to enquire whether her flight
Be true, or to what place she made escape.
No certainty is known, but all the Court
Troubled with doubts, shortly you will hear more.
If you could bring me sir to Prospero,
Or to the Prince, on some affairs that may
Perhaps advantage them, and my own good,
You shall oblige me much to serve you in
My better state of fortunes
I will endeavour it, and as you find
Me ready to assist all your requests,
I hope sir, you'll see cause to pay your ran∣some
With what haste you can, for I would fine be able
To doe good deeds, &amp; we have many poor
In the town that want their charity, who have
A will as ready as their wealth.
Believe me you express a soul that hath
Been bred, and exercised in holy thoughts.
Faith sir not much, only you know a man
Would joy to doe some good whilst he's a∣live,
For after death our gifts I ever thought
Rather proceeded from a devout necessity,
Than any free desire.
Tic wisely urged.
It hath been a maxim I have held long.
And it becomes you still; my ransom shall
Be suddenly prepared.
I thank you sir; follow, &amp; Isle procure
You an address to the prince or Prospero.
If she were fled, her person is of so
Esteemed, and eminent a rate, that straight
Her instant residence must needs be known.
There is much art in these affairs; how will
She look on me, that in so great a cause
Could strike, or yield to angry fate? I will
Endure her scorns, as a deserved reward,
Nor should a lovers hopes grow cold be∣cause
The Influence that last did govern him,
Was sick, and cold, that destiny is gone,
The firmament contains more stars than one.
It glads me to behold your strength so well
Restored, and sir, I wish the fortune of
My sword, had met another cause, &amp; enemy;
Your ransom I have paid, and so much prize
Evandra's happiness, that since you maked
Appear your company will render her
Some quietness, and joy, in this her sad
And solitary state, you shall both see, and stay with her.
From my first infancy I took my speech
And breeding in her fathers court, and by
My nearness to her, both in deeds and place
In the day of fight, you may believe I am
Of quality enough to be esteemed and well∣comed in her misery.
Your valour then did speak you more than all
The praise your modesty can urge,
My Lord, it is your gentleness to have
A courteous faith, but I am bold to think
My sight will comfort her so much that she
Will pay you thanks for giving so free trust
Unto my confidence.
My kindness to you I shall reserve
Till happier hours, this sir, is for her sake,
That she may have the benefit of your
Approach, retire a while within, that key
When I am gone, will open you a door,
That leads unto a cave.—
Melora? where art thou? this way, the light
Conducts thee; thou art safe.
How dark, &amp; like the dusty hollowness
Of tombs where death inhabits, this ap∣pears?
Now you shall know the cause why I have bought
Your liberty, Evandra, daughter to
Your Millain duke, lies here imprisoned by
The chance of battle, and thus hidden, and
Reserved, till we can free her by disguise.
O sad discovery of a sorrow worse
Than I endure, I hoped she had escaped.
I heard that thou were taken in her train,
But when the stories of thy beauty and
Thy virtues reached mine ear, I did believe
Thou had familiar knowledge of her face
And thoughts.
I know too much of her, to think that Heaven
Could thus permit her languish in a Cave.
None can resist their destiny; but good
Melora comfort her, and prithee for
Kind pity when your conversation shall
Beget some pleasant hour, mention my care,
And then my love; for know, she hath so wrought
Upon my heart, that trust me I shall melt
Like Tapers overcharged with flame, and die;
Wilt thou implore in my behalf?
Your bounties have obliged me to perform
My best, else I were cruel sir.
Fear no surprise, you are secure, for twice.
To day, my house by sterne Authority
Was searched, but vainly they suspect, and strive
To find this hidden dwelling, that no art
Can imitate for secrefie and depth.
will you be gone?
I'm sent for to the Palace where I'm told
I shall endure for this concealment more
Than natures strength can bear, but L've a soul
Dares welcome it with scorn.
Lend me the light; look, there's Evandra sir.
It is, remember me, that I may live.
This mingled passion of strange grief and joy,
I can no longer quietly contain;
Hail the most beauteous virtue of the world.
Loved Melora, what dismal chance, more than
My sorrow can digest, hath brought thee here?
Why am I thought on, or enquired for as
A creature that deserves a life, whilst you
Remain within the house and arms of death?
I fear thou art a captive too.
Or else the tyranny of war had been
Too much unjust; were it fit you languish thus,
And I like to a wanton bird should play
And wing the air at liberty? and yet
My ransome's freely paid.
Then though art now no prisoner?
A prisoner to you, or else my heart
Were dull, and rudely mannerd to permit
Evandra suffer here alone; this war
Hath quickly nursed strange Riddles too of love.
Thou dost complain with cause, it is in the Prince.
Another of your Enemies; too much
Of leisure I shall have t'acquaint you with
The accident that brought me to your sight.
Melora, who is that?
Bless me how miracles increase to fright
Astonishment! sure there is Magic in
This place; Madam, my Brother Leo∣nel.
Ha Melora? art thou here too? such mysteries
In change so soon arrived I have not read.
But what unheard of star directed thee
To see, and taste our miserable state?
Ere I begin the little history
Of the short time that thus hath varied us,
Low as the earth I full to make you pitiful. Kneels
For give the crime of destiny, not me,
That left me feeble as an Aguish girl
With the faint loss of blood, when I had took
Upon my youth &amp; strength, the noblest cause
That ere employed the anger of a man,
Your liberty; but Leve•ites, and Doves
Are more valiant than I, for else what make
You in captivity?
Believe me sir, your passion is so great
I understand it not; pray rise, I know
You fought with all the forward will and might
That humane rage could show, but the success
Of valour they above dispose, that are
More wise and stronger than our selves.
Sure I could weep, but that my eyes
Have not enough of sunerall dew to melt
Away 〈◊〉, pray pardon my neglect.
You'll find I am not courteous to my self.
The time compels distracted thoughts in all.
There is a bank within, though cold and bare,
Where never flower (in a despair of sun)
Durst fix his root, there we will fit, talk and
Compare our miseries; then sing like Philo∣mel.
That wisely knows the darkness only fit
For mourning and complaint; lead there the light.
Evade me not with such fond cir∣cumstance,
Fit only to persuade the easiness
Of untaught babes; have I not here received
Her fathers letters, that petition her
Release? why should he sooth me thus with low
Demeanour in his phrase, if she were free?
Or if not in the town enclosed and hid,
Where would she sooner fly than to his arms?
Sir, give my duty boldness to believe
If she were here, &amp; some good man (that now
Conceals her in his piteous fear) shall to
Assuage your wrath deliver her, you would
Nor mark her out for death?
No sir, how cheap then, and how frail will you
Suppose my vows? what need we trick,
And dress our Altars with such reverend care
Lets rather straight pervert their use, grease them
With gluttony, and feasts, defile and wash
Them with the riots of excessefull wine;
Is perjury the least of guilt you can
Persuade me to commit?
I wish you would allow my obedience leave
To utter truth; the vow you made was rash,
And not confirmed with oath, or church so∣lemnitie.
And I am taught the cruelties, or the
Revenge we threaten, heaven is pleased when they
Are never acted but forgot.
Her sterne, and deathed father, when we sought
And wooed his mercy with humility,
More than dejected Hermits on their knees
Render to Saints, used not my brother with
Remorse, but snatched him from the world in all
His pride of youth, his wise, and ripened thoughts,
When he was fit to rule a nations fate,
And exercise mankind in what was bold,
And good, then shall I not revenge the best
Of all my blood, whilst I have here the chief of his.
Alas, this act sir, was not hers, nor in
The justice of our reason is it possible
By derivation or descent to share a guilt.
Would I had lost the benefit of strength
When I surprised her, to become the instru∣meant
And pleasure of your rage.
How Count? so bold? hear me thou saucy child
And minion of the war, whom fortune, not
Success from virtue sprung, hath listed to
A pride more dangerous than traitors thoughts,
Though I have searched thy house, &amp; am de∣feated by
Some charm of my discovery, I still
Believe thou know her residence, &amp; bring
Her to my sight, ere yet the Sun decline, or thou shalt die.
I must not live to see it then, nor can
My business here on earth, entice me to
One minutes stay in my mortality,
When I behold your goodness so deceit.
Alvaro was that said like one that knows
His duty to a Father, and a Prince?
I would be heir unto your virtue sir,
As well as to your blood.
Have I outlived my courage, of∣fice, and
My reason too, tamely to suffer this?
I know thy false ambitious cunning well,
Thou fain would vex my weary soul away
That thou might reign, and triumph ore my tomb;
But hear, and tremble at my vow.
Sir, for regard of heaven repent what you
Would speak, ere uttered it become too great
A sin for mercy to excuse.
No more fond Calladine, I am re∣solved,
Since thou art covetous to own his guilt,
He shall be safe, and thou endure his punish∣meant;
Bring me Evandra here ere yet the day
Conceal his light, or the next darkness shall
Eternally be thine
If on my knees I can persuade you to
An easier doom, thus I endeavour it.
I beg not to entreat your rigour less,
But as it was first designed you would convert
It all on me.
That kindness was ill mannered Pro∣spero;
Dost think thou art more worthy of the cause
When it is to be Evandra's Sacrifice?
Ne'er strive, thou shalt have suffe∣rance enough,
And gloriously, alone; hence from my fight
Thou birth ill gotten, and my marriage stain.
Isle keep my duty still, though not your love.
Dread sir, call back your vow, and then the Prince,
Yet comfort him; what will the world esteem
Of such an act as time ne'er paralleled,
And no Posterity be so unkind as to believe?
Thou moist as well persuade th'assem∣bled winds
From all their violence at Sea; lend me
Thine ear—do this, but Calladine take heed
Thy prosecutions are not faint; I have
A younger son in Sicily, renowned
And dear to Fame, him I will strive to plant
In the peoples hearts; as thou are Loyal follow me.
Just in the posture as you see me Gen∣tlemen,
Not a hair less in the Lock; and I believed
The heart of woman was not able to
Resist such amorous forms.
But she would none?
Name her the pleasures of the mar∣riage bed,
She cries she is more taken with the grave,
Because there we are not waked with cough not aches.
Why sure she knows, for she looks as she had
Been long buried.
And then I used fine phrases,
And talked (what call you it?) of Hymens Tapers,
Which she interprets sir, according to
Some modern Doctresse of her Sect, Hell fire,
A warmth (you know) we Soldiers do abhor.
It is base to need it after death; we have
Been hardly bred, and can endure the cold. Enter Widow, and Lily.
She comes, this is her breathing room, use your
Endeavours Gentlemen; tell her, her frowns
Already have so wrought, that my life now
Will ne'er be fit to come into a Lease.
Lily a Chair, I cannot last; it is more
Than 58 years since I had hams to trudge.
I am your Guardian that come to vi∣sit you.
What need it sir? I practice no escape, I cannot fly.
No? were the window open
You would behave your self as nimbly on
Your wings as any witch in Europe.
What says he Lily, a witch?
He says we must one day all fly up∣ward,
Heaven is the place we wish for.
It is well said sir, for thither we must go,
Both old and young, no remedy.
As soon as you please if you're but marry me.
Does he talk of marriage?
He says, if you please for sooth.
Alas my vow of widowhood is not yet
Expired; if he comes some ten years hence—
About that time she'll make a good wife
For an Antiquary to get Records on.
Although her skin be Parchment, it is not large
Enough to write her Annals in, sn'ath lived so long already.
How did you like the cullelse wi∣dow that I sent you last?
Why sir? It went down.
Though the Sea were turned to plum broth, t'would all down;
I have measured her throat, it is wider (gent.)
And deeper than a well; alas the Duke
Considers not my charge, I'd rather boold
Too Young Giants, and allow each of them
A wolf in stead of a dog t'eat) their frog∣mints.
Thou should get her month searched, I'll lay my life
Sh'ath new furnished her gummes with artifi∣ciall teeth,
She could not grind so else.
Though you must seed her at your own cost, the proclamation
Believe me allows none but natural teeth.
When she is once in the fit of swallow∣ing,
If a cap on float in her broth, why she
Considers it no more than a small bee, or a May fly.
You should bear up, you are too backward sir.
Say thou so wench; widow prepare your self,
For I must marry you to night, or else
You fast to morrow; if the Duke will not
Afford us fasting days, I shall make bold
To borrow em of the Calendar; this night;
No longer time to delay a good deed.
Vh, uh, uh.
This cough (Vasco) is of some great antiquity.
How wilt thou sleep by her?
A little Opium after supper, and let her cough like a
Cannon from a sort, I'll free thee from wa∣king.
Come, come, provide; trim up your hood widow.
And ayre your petty coats in the sun, it is
A case of conscience Gent. we must
All marry, and live chaste.
Why sir, if we must needs.
I thought she would consent; good heart; it is
As towardly an old thing. Dear Vasco,
Provide us music, we'll dance her to death:
Thou shalt be her husband ere night, and her
Executor before morning.
Sooth Gent. that's all I desire,
Any thing, that is reason contents me.
Go, kiss her, by this hand a Brownest (is
More amorous; a notched premice a very
Aretine in comparison of thee.
By your leave widow.
Much good may it do you sir; these comforts come
But seldom after fourscore, the world (indeed)
Is grown so wicked that we never think
Of comforting one another.
I told you she would soften sir; alas,
A little raw, and modest at the first.
A very green pippin of the last years growth.
You shall find me a kind of sparrow widow,
A barley corn does as much as a potato.
Blessing on your heart sir, we should doe good
Freely (as they say) without egging on.
Rise, and stir your feet, it is health∣full for you.
There—softly,—so—
If one of the hairs of my eye brow lye
But in her way, she's gone, and falls like an
Elephant, whose legs are cut with a chain shot.
Her Os Sacrum needs a little Prop.
Why Gentlemen, ther's ne'er a wench in Italy
Moves farther in a day, provide her litter
But easy, and her two mules well fed.
Courage widow; how is it now?
A certain stitch sir in my side, but t'will away in time.
I you are young enough,
But given too much to hoyting, and to bar∣lie break,
Then dance naked till you take cold; good faith
You must look too't Lily, take heed you air
Her wedding smock.
Let it be made of Cats skin fur:
Or a watch mans rug gown, but that her skin
Will wear it out too soon.
Frivolo, yo are too load.
I warrant thee I have measured her ears,
She hears in distance but an inch length.
You'll in, and set the house in order widow? I'll fetch a priest.
Truly sir, I'd fine ask my friends advice,
One that hath seen but little of the world
Would be glad you know of counsel.
No counsel widow, nay, if you want metal
Let them call it rashness, our youth will ex∣cuse all.
Well Sir, you know where marria∣ges are made,
It is not my fault; Lily, provide a broom
And sweep away the rheum near the green Couch;
And (d' you hear) look for one of my cheek teeth
That dropped under the wanscore bed.
And shall I stopped forsooth with salt?
I, and fling't 'ith fire; you are weary sir?
No quite so lusty (widow) as your self,
But shall keep pace the journey being so short.
Quick, in with her Uasco, whilst the fit holds.
With cable and thong he drew her along,
 so heavily to the Priest,
And vowed to unto her, ere he did woo her, 
make her up after who list.
Ah Rogue, thou art a very Lark in the morning.
And what at night Frivolo?
A very owl.
Thou art a coxcomb, beyond all redemption
Of wit, less thou straight resolve to marry Lily;
Thy friends will think the match so fit, none shall
Forbid the banes; I knew her mother too:
She's wondrous rich in pewter, small wine cask,
And spits.
Yes, I have heard of the wealthy Dowager,
She kept a the ch'd Nunnery in my quarter.
Wher's Uasca Gentlemen? I am in haste.
Why then for more dispatch an∣swer you self.
The Duke hath sent for him, by Calladine,
Who told me it was for business of import;
The Court is all disturbed, but for what use
He is designed, I cannot learn; where is he?
Follow, we'll convey thee to him; strange luck;
Sir Leonells ransom, this widows wealth,
And now employed at Court? Uasco you are a gon man,
Usury, furrd gowns, long dinners, and short sleeps,
Thou art condemned to without help; or hope.
Sister, where is your tenderness? shall I
Be ever lost through your defect of will
And courage to present me to her care
In winning characters? tell her how long
With fervency I have pursued my love.
Unhappy Lionel, why dost thou tempt
Me with impossible desires how oft
Have I solicited thy suit with a
Repulse? and she hath charmed me by a vow
Never to mention's more, till her release.
False Lionel, did I for this assist
Thee to enjoy her loved society,
That thou should rival me, and have more fit
Convenience for thy wishes, than me self?
Melora is his sister too, what strange
New chances have these later hours pro∣duc'd?
I have no Advocate, nor am I hold
Enough to be mine own.
I see you love me not;
And since I am a trouble to your sight,
Ere long thou shalt behold my face no more.
Thou art a Prophet to thy self, and I
Thy Priest to cut thee out in Sacrifice,
Although unworthy of Evandras deity.
Melora, can you show no kind re∣morse?
Alas, you do mistake my power and will;
Think on some other beauty, for the world
Hath many that may make you fortunate.
None but Evandra governs in my breast.
Her thou shalt ne'er enjoy; lend me thine ear—
Ha! Prospero?
False Knight; was this the cause
That made thee beg concealed admittance here
To practice love where I had planted mine?
My Lord I understood not of your love.
If thou art bold, and since thy van∣quishment
Dare tempt a second hazard of my sword,
Go waite me on the garden mount, there I
Will order, though my heart is doubtful to
Enjoy Evandras love, thine never shall.
I will expect thee there, and fierce∣lie long
To ravish from thy crest the honour that
I lent thee in our former fight.
Evandra, reach me thy fair hand that I
Seal on it my last farewell.
Ha, whither do you go?
Where shadows vanish when the worlds eye wincks,
Behind a cloud, and they are seen no more;
The place of absence where we meet (by all
The guess of learned thought) we know not whom,
Only a prompt delight we have in faith
Gives us the easy comfort of a hope,
That our necessity must rather praise than fear as false.
O horrid mystery! my tender sen∣ses are amazed▪ I fine
Would learn what it is dangerous to know.
Why do the stars neglect us thus? why should
We lose the noblest and the best of men?
Me thinks my spirits climb and life me to
A valiant envy of his sufferings.
That thou may live here safe till Prospero
Restore thee unto liberty and light,
I must to darkness go, hover in clouds,
Or in remote untroubled air, silent
As thoughts, or what is uncreated yet:
Or I must rest in some cold shade where is
No flowery spring, nor everlasting growth,
To ravish us with sent, and show, as our
Philosophy hath dreamt, and rather seems
To wish than understand.
All this for me; you shall not dye; why will
You lay so cheap a value on your self,
To think the world should lose you for my sake,
Alas, a needless trivial Virgin that
Can never show in hopeful promise half
That excellence which you reveal in art?
It is decreed; Evandra thou may live
To increase the small example we have lest
Of virtue, which hath made thy breast her throne;
Time hath begun to wear away my youth,
And all the good I can perform is to
Preserve the future hope of it in thee.
Melora, help, sorrow hath filled my heart
With such a heaviness, that I must sink
Beneath its weight—here let me lye, and morn,
And chide that haughty destiny that thinks
Us so unworthy of their care.
My Lord the Prince, Is it no less than death
Of her, or you, can ease your Fathers wrath?
The doom is past, and the sad hour will want
No wings to hasten its approach; come hi∣there Prospero.
It must not be; though I want phrase to show
My nature smooth, it shall appear in deeds.
I charge thee by our love, by all my care
That bred thee from thy childhood to a sense
Of honour, and the worthiest feats of war,
Thou keep Evandra safe till happier days
Conspire to give her liberty, use her
With such respective holiness as thou
Would do the relics of a Saint inshrind,
And teach thy rougher manners tenderness
Enough to merit her society.
What need this conjuration sir? I mean
To dye for her, that I may save your life;
A brave design, dissuade me not, though I
Fail oft in choice of fitting enterprise,
I know this is becoming sir, and good.
Thou dye for her? alas poor Pros∣pero
That will not satisfy, the shaft aims here,
Or if it would, I do not like thou should
Thus press into a cause that I reserve
To dignify my self; urge it no more.
What am I fit for then, if not to die.
How am I worthy of this noble strife?
Evandra rise, that I may see some hope
And comfort in thy strength, before I take
My everlasting leave.
You have the voice of death alrea∣die sir.
Dismal it sounds, like the last groan which men
In torture breath out with their soul.
I could have wished I might enjoy thee and
Be mortal still, mix in a love that should
Produce such noble virtues as would soon
Entice the Angels to live here, yet not
B'our conversation grow impain'd; but these
Are wishes made too high, and late to thrive.
For evermore farewell.—
O sir, where will you leave me then?
How pity moistens me? there in the Cave.
It is the mansion Sir of death, something
Horrid as midnight thoughts can form so frights
Me still, I tremble when I enter it.
Ha! what that is but humane dares disturb thy quietness?
Sir let me see, it dies if it be vulne∣rabble.
Still you usurp my Business Pro∣spero—
Bide there, I will go down my self.
Sir, twill not presently appear.
I will attend its saucy leisure then. descends the Cave.
Lock safe the door Melora with this Key.
VVhat's your design? mean you t'imprison him?
Discover (Prospero) the inside of
Thy breast; dost thou affect the Prince?
Next to the absent blessings that our faith
Persuades us to, eternity of joys.
Why then wilt thou permit that he should taste
A long forgetfulness in a dark grave?
Let us invent some way to ease him of
This penance undeserved, and suffer it our selves.
O glorious maid! th's goodness will confer
A dignity for ever on our Sex.
I'm strangely taken with this virgins thoughts,
Let me embrace your hand upon my knee—
I thank you much, you have some mercy on
My dull unknowing youth, and can believe
Me fit for noble enterprise, though he
Unkindly did deny my suit: Isle to
The Duke and tempt his fury till he cause
My death, perhaps when his revenge hath quenched
Her thirst with my warm blood, it may grow cold,
And kindly tempered to you both,
And then I've fully satisfied the crime
Of your captivity, and his free sufferance.
This Soldier hath a great and da∣ring heart.
But how shall I enjoy her then? I scarce
Can understand the happiness it bears:
Tic odd ambition this, but yet it is brave,
He do it: besides, though I'm not learned to know
With certainty, yet I have hope I shall
Be sensible of all her visits to
My tomb, and every flower she strewes will there
Take growth as on my garden banks, whilst I
(Delighted spirit) walk and hover about
Their leaves, comparing still their sent with hers;
O twill be wondrons brave! Lady, dispatch,
That I may go, and die.
Since you express your will, so kind, and violent,
That small provision there allotted to
Sustain my life, reach up, and straight con∣vii
Into the cave, that he may find it out,
And not exchange the pain his father would
Inflict, for famishment.
I had almost forgot false Lionel,
He waits me on the mount, I will be with
Him straight, and end his hopes by a long sleep
Ere I begin mine own.
Once more Melora lock the door; now they
Are both secure, tic thou and I that must
Take solemn leave, and never meet in this
Our beauty, colour, or our warmth again.
I am astonished at her excellence,
And scarce have humble grace enough to keep
Ambitious envy from my thoughts.
Why should these mighty spirits lay so vast
An obligation on our sex, and leave
Eternal blushes on our souls, because we
In acts of kinder pity, and remorse
(The virtues sure, wherein we most excel)
Durst not adventure like to them?
The Prince deserves a liberal choice of lives
To ransom his; would mine would satisfy.
How Melora? I cannot think thou dost
So faintly love my happiness, and my
Renown, to wish to hinder me of both.
Alas, th'example is so good, I fine would follow it.
But there is reason that I suffer first.
I have a mourning weed within which thou
Shalt dress, and teach me wear, then so
Apparelled like my cause, I'll walk to'th Duke.
O leave me not behind, let me ac∣company
Your mourning too, perhaps my death may be
Accepted best, and you bee thought more fit to live.
Thy inclinations have a noble sense,
Thou shalt along; go, call thy brother in,
And call aloud, this hollowness is such
He will not hear thee else.
Hoe, Lionel? my brother Lionel.
Tic strange, this Prospero appears not yet,
Sure he is faint, and's aguish courage comes
To him by fits; what is your will?
If thou dost love me Lionel (as thou
Hast sworn, and with assertions most devout)
I know there is no strict command I can
Present, but thy obedience will perform.
Bring me to trial straight, if I prove weak
Or false, I am unworthy to appear
In the suns light, or evermore enjoy
The better influence of your eyes.
Give me confirmed assurance on your knee
That you will execute with real faith,
And punctual circumstance, what I injone.
Let me salute your hand, I breath on it my vow.
Now Isle inform thee Lionel; the Prince
And Prospero are both within the cave,
Shut and enclosed by us, where hourly thou
Through a small slender wicket shall it convey
Such food, as a disguised servant of
The house (who heretofore provided our
Relief) shall help thee to, take here this key
And not permit their passage forth, till I
Am gone t'ordaine by death their liberty
Secure, which I will suffer to appease the angry Duke.
Furies and Fiends cease on my senses straight;
What have I promised in the rashness of
My dull and inconsiderate love?
If thou dost break thy vow the cur∣ses of
The Saints, and mine (which dying will not least
Afflict thy perjury) fall on thy heart.
Never be called my brother, nor assume
The honour of my valiant Fathers name.
Melora come, we are too slow in such
An act as will outlive all history.
O what a dull inhumane Lover am
I grown! that simply by a forward and
Unskilful duty can consent the Queen
And Lady of my life should be a Sacrifice
To hinder others deaths? this sure is such
A great example of a female fortitude
As must undo all men, and blushing make
Us steal from our unjust advancement ore
The world; tear off our saucy beards before
The scatt'ring winds that give us the prehe∣minence
Of Sex; when this is known let women sway
Counsels, and war, whilst feeble men obey.
A Lady say thou in a mourning Vest?
What should this early visit mean, ere yet
By full appearance of the Sun we can
Distinguish day from night?
Sir, she importunes much to speak with you,
Says her affair asks secrecy and haste.
Retire a while without, and let her in.
Since first my eyes had judgement to di∣scorn
A mean from excellence, they ne'er beheld
A beauty so ore coming and exact;
What are the loved commands you'd lay on me?
I not remember that I ever saw
A face I would more willingly obey;
If it were civil too I'd ask your name.
Believe me gentle Sir when that is known
You'll think me too unfortunate to live;
I am called Evandra.
Ha! the Princess? wisely did Prospero
Preserve thee from my sight, thy beauty is
Too great and dangerous for youth to know
And be secure; though I ne'er saw her till
This blessed hour, yet Fame assisted me
T'imagine an Idea like her self;
But why have you forsaken your concealed
Abode, and thus adventure into th'view
Of men? I fear it is not safe.
It is to employ your virtue sir; I know
You love the Prince, though not with so de∣vote
A heart as mine; for that I may restore
Him unto liberty and's Fathers love,
I here present my self to cruel death.
This is a valiant piety, a gratitude
That shows her mind more noble than her shape;
She is not known unto the Duke more than
By guessing Characters tan from report;
She must not dye; though lately his com∣mands
Have singled my allegiance out, it is
Religious sure to fail in this.
Sir, expectation of the ills we must
Endure do more perplex us than the pain
It self. I crave you'd not protract my suffe∣rance.
My thoughts have fashiond it unto my wish;
Is there not a captive called Melora,
(Most beautiful and young) that hath of late
Familiar been to your society?
I fear he hath discovered me;
Do you know the Lady sir?
Only by Prospero's report, and I
In charity desire her person safe;
Your death alone will satisfy the Duke.
My prayers have much endeavoured that it may;
And Sir to assist your kind humanity
Receive this key, twill give you entrance where
She now remains a prisoner by my art;
It is a narrow Closet that ore looks
The Orchard grove; you know the house, it is Prospero's.
I am familiar there with all the vaults,
And hidden passages.
Sir, for regard of honour suffer not
Her freedom from that place, till I am dead,
For she's so much delighted with this cause,
That with unwilling falsehood I was fine
To take advantage of her orisons,
And whilst she kneeling lengthned her dis∣course
With heaven, steal on this funeral habit, and
In haste close up the door to hinder her
Pursuit, where now she stays lamenting her
Enforced secure estate, and envying of
This danger which I cheerfully embrace.
My life shall warrant hers, be pleased to enter there,
And stay till I inform the Duke of your ap∣pearance and approach.
Most willingly; but still sir I implore your mercy would
Secure that Lady, and the Prince, how ere
The angry stars provide for me.
It is no less unkind t'importune than
To doubt my care; there Lady, through that door—
Expect my sad return will be too soon.
Forgive me best Evandra, that I thus
Assume thy name, and have beguiled thee of
So brave a death, the motive that persuades me to it
Did not become thy knowledge nor my tongue.
This Princess hath a soul I could adore
Whilst it remains eclipsed on earth, nor shall
It yet reach heaven; both being utterly
Unknown, will make the plot with easy help
Succeed. Melora straight I will present
T'appease the fury of the Duke, and then
This Lady and the Prince are free; through blood
Is the best issue of our hopes; if fate
Ordain it thus, I shall prove fortunate.
Come boy, lift up your voice to you 'bay window.
Sing the Song I gave you last night, and firk
Your fiddles bravely too, bear up the bur∣then.
No morning red, and blushing fair, be through your glass, or curtains spied,
But cloudy gray, as the short hair, of your old everlasting Bride.
So old, so wondrous old, in the nonage of Time,
Ere Adam wore beard, she was in her Prime.
Whose swarthy, dried westphalia hipps, are shrunk to mummy in her skin,
Whose gummes are empty, and her lips, like eyelids hairy and as thin.
So old so wondrous old, &amp;c.
For Amorous sighs which virgins use, she coughs aloud from lungs decayed,
And with her palsy cannot choose but shake, like th'trembling of a maid.
So old, so wondrous old, &amp;c.
And when her nightly labour swells, to vast extent, her pregnant womb,
Midwives believe, that it foretells, a hopeful Timpani to come.
So old, so wondrous old, &amp;c.
What need her husband then vex heaven, and for a plenteous off-spring beg,
Since all the Issue can be given, is that which runs in her leg.
So old, so wondrous old, &amp;c.
Good morrow to the right worship∣full leader Captain Vasco,
And to's his right reverend Bride.
Now gentlemen scrapers you may be gone:
My good friends, a certain salt shower should have
Seasoned your feathers, had not my luck bin
To marry with one that consumes all her moisture
In thume, a mere Egyptian cloud for drought.
But why so soon abroad? Vasco are these
A Bridegrooms hours? thou art as early up
As creditors in the Term.
Or Sergeants when
The needy gallant means to steal a jour∣ney.
And they prevent it by arresting his innocent horse.
Business at Court; but Gentlemen this is
A resurrection to me, believe it
I'm risen from the dead, from bones more dusty
Than theirs that did begin their sleep be∣neath
A marble Coverlet some thousand years ago.
Alas poor Vasco! widows can strangely mortify.
Put Dates and Amber in the Gruel Lily,
And let it boyle long.
And shall I make the Poultice straight, and send
Your other hood forsooth to be new lined?
First stay till you have ripped my vel∣vet muff,
Isle have that lining serve.
She's risen too; pure soul,
Devotion and Aches keep her still waking.
How do you Sir? we must comfort one another.
There is need of't, no Mariner ere had
A worse• •ight in a storm.
〈◊〉 is usage Vasco will hardly mollify
Her Iron Chest, and make her bags open.
Nay, I've tan order for her wealth if she
Would be so courteous now to die.
Believe me, you'll find her very obstinate
Touching that point; it is true, a woman that
Had the least dram of kindness or of reason
Would for her husbands benefit depart
This transitory at a minutes warning,
Make a low curtsy, take her leave and die,
With less noise than flies forsake us in a frost.
I, you speak of kind reasonable women,
Alas she's of another mould; she'd think it
A strange request if I should urge it to her,
Though it be evidently for my good.
What is it for her to dye once? alas,
She knows well she hath eight lives more to come.
Frivolo says right. I think Captain it were fit
You make a motion to her; see how twill work.
Never Gentlemen; if her own good nature
Will not persuade her to it, let her even live
Till she be thought so much a Ghost, that the state
Command her take a house in a Church-yard,
And never walk but at midnight.
What do they say Lily?
Forsooth devising for your worships good.
Kind heart! me thinks you are not merry Sir.
Who, I? as jovial as a condemned man I.
Will you fit down and eat a little broth?
I shall be cawdled like a Haberda∣shers wife
That lies inn of her first child; but methinks
Upon a stricter view you look not well,
Your blood absents it self, are you not faint?
I, and her eyes shrink, and retire into
Their melancholy cells; your breath smells somewhat
Of earth too, but it is nor much.
By'rlady but take heed, my Grandam thus
Was taken spinning at her wheel, and died
So quickly (as they say) as one would wish.
I've seen a Coarse look better in a shroud.
If you have any business now with heaven
It were fit your prayers were short, for I much fear
You'll not have breath enough to utter it.
It is more than I feel; look I so ill Lily?
As you were wont forsooth, most strange and uggly.
Come, lead me in: pray husband do not grieve,
Tic but a sit that ever takes me once
In fifty years: but weep hot, twill away.
Every tear shall be as big as a turnip
When I weep; the good pox comfort you, Wench
Follow the game close, still breath death to her.
Warrant you sir, I cannot do a better
Deed than put her in mind still of her end.
Marry a widow, and be coffind up
With clouts and a skeleton? by this day,
I lay last night locked in surgeons box;
Compared unto her bed, a Apothecaries binge
Is a Venetian couch, and Canopy.
Those that seek gold, must dig for it in mines.
Well my camp companions, what think you now
Of the court? I am sent for thither to take charge
Of what is yet the moitie of a miracle.
But you are all content to thrive, to jet
And strut like lustful Turkeys with your plumes spread.
Tic not amiss; my good Lord Frivilo,
I kiss your soft hands; noble sir keep on
Your Cordovan, I swear your glove is a
Preferment, 'bove the merit of my lips.
You cherish my ambition sir—seignior
your professed slave: I pray keep on
Your way, I'd rather build another wall
Than to dishonour you by taking this.
Believe it sir, both hands must be cut off
Ere I mistake to place you near the left.
This practise will do well, follow a∣pace,
I must with speed to Caladine.
It is strange, it seems he knows me not, and that
The falsely, kind Melora wears my name
He speaks as if her life he tendered more
Than mine, 't is a mistake I fine would che∣rich.
I did not think the stock of nature could,
In this her colder age, be rich enough
To store the world with two such beauties that
Together take their growth, and flourishing,
And this unto my instant judgement seems
(If such amazing forms admit of diffe∣rinse)
The more exact, but that the blood &amp; stile
Of Princess makes the other claim our reve∣rinse
As well as love, and for Alvaro's sake, I wish
I could procure that she might live.
I have considered what you told me sir,
And though the Princess through a fond ex∣cesse
Of love, would hasten a calamity
That all the world must grieve and wonder at,
Yet I could give her reason an excuse,
For I my self to ease her sufferance
Could willingly endure the same.
It ripens more, and swifter than my hopes
Design; you reach at an ambition Lady,
So great and good, my wonder interrupts
My language still, I cannot prais't enough.
Can such a virtuous courage dwell in your sex?
If you uprightly love her and the Prince,
(Whose care she is) straight lead me to the Duke,
And try how real my professions are.
Forgive the office you invite me to,
Which by the hopes of my religion could
My life excuse, I should esteem't too cheap
An offering; this, Lady, is the fatal way—
Melora, now my fortune is above
Thy art, and I shall equal thee in love.
Again in low petitionarie stile
He begs me by these letters to release
His daughter, and doth proffer sums so vast
To ransom her, as would overcome the co∣vetous:
But I have sent him such denial, with
Disdain, as must distract and break his heart.
Vasco, yo've heard how ill I am obeyed
By these persum'd smooth traitors of the Court,
And I have chosen you to show a duty
Fitting the stricter discipline of war,
To actuate all my will with instant diligence.
You must enjoin me sir commands that are
Most horrid, and unnatural, when I
Prove slow, or faint to execute.
If these your officers and friends become
Disloyal to your will, you may provide
The rack and tortures to enforce em too't.
If their own appetites will not persuade.
There is small hope from punishment.
Mark sir, that whey-fac'd fellow in the red,
The Rack is his delight, and gives him as
Much ease, as when he's stretched with la∣zinesse
And a cool mornings sleep.
Is it possible!
I've seen him suffer the Strapado thrice,
Hang in this politic posture in the ayre,
As he were studying to circumvent nature,
And no sooner down but calls for a wench.
I know you have the skill to govern them.
Be sure that Prospero's house be diggd until
The pinnacles and the foundations meet.
Unless they deal by sorcery and charms,
I'll find these buried lovers out, and my
False son the Prince, that covets darkness more
Than blessed light, or my respect.
I doe not like this business should concern
The Prince; although the rack be somewhat out
Of season with my old bones, for his sake
I shall become a parcel traitor too.
I feared that Caladine delaying his
Return so long, might frustrate all my glory;
And how Evandra's skill might work with him
Was dangerous. I doe not see her here.
Pray heaven my Master do not check my forwardness
To obey your will; he meant you should keep home.
My presence here will make his be∣nefit;
I told thee so before; trust my excuse in thy behalf.
What Ladye's that?
One that to pleasure you with a re∣avenge,
Present my self to execution, with
As liberal joy, as to the marriage priest.
And when I name my self Evandra, you
Will know enough to satisfy your wrath.
Is the beloved Bird flown from the dark cage?
Their magic was not strong enough to hen∣der destiny,
And you will find small amorous pity in
My frozen age. My guard cease on her straight.
Vasco, this is Melora my prisoner?
Peace Devil, peace, thou wilt de∣stroy brave mysteries.
A noble girl; I conceive all; now would
My gracious widow be burnt to char-coale
Ere she had brain, or nature for a plot
Like this; I could eat her, and her clothes too,
By this hand, her very shoes were a rare mess.
If you expect to find me here a lowly suitor,
Tic but to hasten sir your glad content
With a dispatch upon my life, and that
The Prince may be •ton'd unto your love.
Her spirit seems to stir my man∣hood more
Than it astonisheth my sense. I am
Resolved to farther your desires (brave dame)
With all the help of cruelty and haste.
Death slave, what make you here? the Princess too?
Why did you give her liberty?
She told me sir, it was with your consent.
She hath ore'reach'd my skill, I am undone.
Stay Caladine, another prize? come back
And render me that Ladies name.
He knows it not; my name's Evan∣dra sir.
I fear I am deprived of my intent.
We must to Delphos sure t'untie these doubts
And wonders with an Oracle.
Do not believe that Lady sir, she hath
Beguiled me of my name, and is so sick
And fond with an improper love, she would
Betray her self unto a pain, she knows
Not how to merit nor endure like me.
O Sir, I find her language is most apt
And powerful to persuade, but let your faith
Consider my affections too.
Why dost thou let thy kindness wrong we thus,
Undoing thy Religion with thy love?
It is you confer the Injury, that will
Not suffer me to dye in peace.
Rare wenches both; all this is for the Prince.
Though small inquiry would dis∣cover soon
Who justifies the truth, yet I will end
The difference so as shall afford you equal joy,
And not endanger a mistake in me;
Convey them to the Fort, they shall both die.
Hath this Duke buried all his good∣ness in's
Reverge! sure he is libd, he hath certainly
No masculine business about him.
Lead them away.
Isle follow too, and morn the obe∣sequy
Ere ceremonious death make it complete.
Forgive this emulation (Madam) you
Shall know a cause that will invite you to it.
Poor Melora! I pity not my self but thee
Now let my Son, and's Minion Prospero
(Rebellious as himself) resign to the Fiends
Their dark and hidden tenements again,
Come forth free and secure, for since they valued death
As a delight they shall not suffer it;
Go strait proclaim their next appearance safe,
For it will pleasure me they should stand by
To see, and not be able to resist, the justice of revenge.
Sure revenge is a strange kind of Le∣cheri;
How it hath altered him!
Vasco, now the enchanted house may stand;
But be you here to morrow with some strength
To guard their execution from impediments
Of rage, or pity; they shall suffer early.
I thank your grace for any employ∣meant.
Altesto, art thou a rogue?
A little (Sir) infected with your company.
Art thou so very a rogue, if I com∣mand.
Thee from the Duke, to cut off these Ladies heads,
Thou'lt whet the Axe thy self, and do it with the
Dexterity of a Flemming?
I will see thy head in a leathern case first,
Kicked in a footbal match from gole to gole.
Why I thank thee; what say you Frivolo,
Wenches and Surgeons have cost you dear,
Have you remorse enough to do it?
I've a mind rather to rebel, break shops
Open, and make choice of my silks, without
Taking notice (sir) of the Mercers book.
Such wholesome business would more take me too
Than cutting off poor Ladies heads, unless
Your fair widow (Vasco) come in my reach,
I could behead her for her left ear ring,
Though it be but an Agate set in Copper.
Come let's to bed; the Sun to more∣row will
Rise black, or I shall think him a dull insane∣sible
Planet, and deserves no more adoration than a farthing candle.
Sir, you have heard how she be∣traid me to
A Vow, and with what cruel menacings
My Sister and her self petitiond heaven
T'assist their curses in a punishment
Upon my after-life, if I were perjured by
A breach of what my promise did assure.
It was a vow no less unkind than rare,
T'imprison us that had no cause nor will
To do a noble stranger injury;
But I have learnt a tame Philosophy,
Persuades me to forgive all but my self.
How comes the date of your strict vow expired,
And that you now afford us liberty?
Which if my memory be just, you said
She did enjoin you should not be, ere she
Was gone to suffer death.
Sir, she is gone, my Sister too; one that
Attends by your command these hidden walks
In breathless haste just now distilled the poi∣sonous news
Through my sick ear.
Gone? and to dye? adorned
(Me thinks) like to an ancient sacrifice
With flowers, which are not sure the issue of
The spring, but of her beauty, and her breath.
Would I had patience to endure ca∣lamities
Like this! but I'm forbid by my galld heart;
Why did you keep us limited and locked
In the Cave when we had power to hinder her
Departure, and her death? it was a bold crime.
Sir, I have hope I gained your par∣don when
I mentioned the misfortune of my vow.
I understand not such injurious vows:
Thou lov'dst her Lionel, and through the pride
Of envy could not yield, since thy own hopes
Grew faint, that mine should ere be prospe∣rous;
Therefore with cunning willingness endured
Her desperate fally to the Duke.
That I did love her sir is a most true
And fitting glory to proclaim; but that
I'm guilty of so base a slander as
Your rashness hath devised provokes me to
A rage that may prove dangerous: reclaim
Your thoughts, and teach them more civ∣lity.
The Prince grows solemn with his grief, lest we
Disturb him let's retire aside, and Isle
Whisper such reasons to thee as shall want
No courage to be truths, though they in∣flame.
Fountains that ever weep have in their tears
Some benefit, they cool the parched earth,
And cherish a perpetual growth; the sad
Arabian tree that still in Balmy drops
Dissolves her life, doth yield for others help
A medicine in those tears: but trivial man
Though he hath sense to morn, may weep and melt
His injured eyes to viewlesse air, yet all
The expense affords is vainly to discern
His mourning gives his sorrows life, and length,
But not the guiltless cause a remedy.
My Lord, I stayed upon the garden Mount,
And in the heate of my impatience was
So kind, much to lament your tardiness;
But now I must have leave to think one that
Delights to heap up wrongs, hath fury more
To dare than do.
Were this a Temple, and the Prince
Employed in the reverend business of a Priest,
I could not suffer such a boast from one
That I have used with so much clemency
In fight—defend thy life, or it is mine.
Are you so masterly—again—I find
No lightning in your eyes, nor in your sword.
You have the skill, but I'll distem∣per it—
Hold, hold, eager and silly ministers
Of wrath, is this a time to bleed, when ere
The morning sun uncloud his pensive face,
There will bee streams of blood let out e∣nough
To make him drink till he be sick with sa∣crifice?
Give me thy sword. How Prospero? are my
Commands grown wearisome and cold—
There sir—I'm still rebuked like to a boy.
How long shall I direct thy temper to
A gentle and a soft demean ere thou
Grow wise, and mild Enough to govern it?
Let me entreat you sir, to sheath your wea∣pone too.
Sir, you are worthy to command; and know
I wear it for my guard, not insolence.
I am appointed all my actions still,
As my stupidity made me not fit
To know, but suffer injuries.
Why dost thou frown? the sullen wrinkles on
A lyons brow carry a grace, because they
Become a beast, but he that can discern
The nobleness of valour should be smooth
As Virgins in their bridal ornaments.
Sir, I am taught; how ere my senses are
Not so mistaken and so weak, but that
They know him false; he loved Evandra.
Is that a crime? thou told me in the cave
Thou lov'dst her too.
I ne'er durst tell you so,
Till you discerned my passions, and enforced
A true discovery of their hidden cause.
But I esteemed it for a virtue known,
And it indeerd thee more to my respect.
Pray tell me sir, did you love Evandra?
And with a heart sincere as she deserved?
Sir, the confession may be honour, but
No shame I did, and with a servencie
Upright as my Religion could produce.
O what a prompt and warm de∣light I feel
When others reason are inclined unto
My choice? it is strange the senseless world should so
Mistake the privilege of love, the best
Of objects! heaven affects plurality
Of worshippers, t'adore and serve, whilst we
In that chief hope are glad of Rivalship;
And why should Ladies then that imitate
The upper beauty most to mortal view,
Be barred a numerous address? or we
Envy each others lawful, though ambitious aim?
Come, join your hands, and seal a friend∣ship here,
Good as inviolate, lasting as truth.
You give my wishes sir, a full content.
I want the skill to promise sir, but Isle
Perform all your desires with noble saith.
And now let me embrace you both, for we
Are lovers all, though when the morn must rise
To see and blush at th'actions of the world,
Like sad distressed Turtles we shall want
Our mate, then we may sit and morn be∣neath
The willow that ore'shaddowes every brook,
There weep, till we are vanished quite in tears
T'increase the stream, whose senseless mur∣murings
Will be excused hereafter in our cause.
O that my heart would be the officer
Of death unto it self, and break without
My irreligious help; my life is tired.
And I have thoughts so wild, so much unsafe,
They would be sin in utterance, as in act.
Give me your hands; with a slow funeral pace
Weel move, to see this dismal Tragedy.
Let's bear it bravely, like such lovers as
Have reason can persuade their courage to
Attempt things bold and fit; whilst there was hope,
We cherished it with proffer of our lives,
But now the strength of Armies cannot free
Her from my fathers wrath; nay, hand in hand—
To show this truth in loves Philosophy,
That as one object equally allures
Th'ambition of our hope, so we not inter∣change
Malignant thoughts; but several lovers, like
Strange Rivers that to the same Ocean trace,
Do when their torrents meet, curl and em∣brace.
Your Letters merit to have power on my
Respect and diligence; I shall afford
You both; but when I bring you to the Duke
It is to be feared you'll find the privilege
Of all my favour there is lost.
Access and audience Sir is all our hopes
Presume to get, the times befriend us not.
We had swift notice of these La∣dies danger;
And Sir, how ere it prove, your wishes must
Oblige us to a lasting gratitude.
What are these strangers Vasco, that envy
Our sleep, and wake us before day?
Ambassadors from Millaine, whose hopes want
Some cordial water, for they are very sick.
Vasco, it is the Dukes command that you
Assemble straight some strength from the cast Regiments
To guard the Palace yard.
What need it Sir? to my knowledge the two Ladits have no
Other weapons than Bodkins, and their nails
Close par'd; besides, a thread of Eglantine,
Or a small wood bine stalk, will setter them
As fast as Cables of a Galley-grosse.
I but deliver what I had in charge.
My Lords Ambassadors this is your way.
These preparations are severe; I doubt
His mind will not be easily reclaimed.
You see the generous people like it not.
Altesto, go and muster up from all
The Lanes and Alleys in the Town a troop
Of fine fleet rogues, such as will turn their backs
To a bullet and outrun it, yet love
Commotion too, I would have such Altesto,
Let me furnish you; hell shall not yield a Regiment
Of Fiends that will be more invisible
At the approach of Justice or Religion.
O for a tiny short trussed Bakes that
I knew; A Carman too, that died some three
Months since with eating meazled pork; they would
Have marched to such a war with cowlestaffe and
Baton like Hercules.
How now? whither move you so fast, like a
Fleet snail over a cabbage leaf, so early too?
She sleeps less than carriers, traitors, or Madmen.
She requests me to be the staff of her age.
But whither I pray?
Why sir, to see the show.
The show! the motion of Queen Guinivers death
Acted by puppets would please you as well;
The Jade too is as full of remorse as
A Bear that wants his supper.
I would have a safe place, where I may stand
And weep without having my handker∣chief
Stolen away.
It is of pure Cambric forsooth,
And made of her Grandmothers wedding Apron.
Yes truly, and wrought when I was a maid.
That's an antiquity beyond all record.
Sir Tristan, be you sure you avoid
No throng; a crowd well shuffled, and close packed,
May do now a special curtsy;
Let her be squeezed, for she's as rotten as
A hollow tree that stands without a root.
My shoulder shall help too at a dead lift.
A Scaffold that were weakly built would serve.
We must make haste; farewell Lamb.
Lamb, which my own translation renders calfe.
Twill be long ere thou grow up to a bull:
For few will venture to help thee to horns.
Well Gentlemen pity my case, I have
Endured another night would tire a Perdu,
More than a wet furrow and a great frost.
Will she not dye?
I have persuaded her, but still in vain;
And all the help the Laws afford us poor
Mistaken men, that marry gold instead
Of flesh, is a divorce, it must be thought
On suddenly; Altesto, haste to your charge.
Good morrow Cavaliers.
Twill be an hour yet before that greeting
Be in season; pray heaven Tristan remember the crowd.
This glorious hazard in thy sister (Lionel)
Doth equally perplex my sufferance
With what the fair Evandra must endure.
You now have heard the cheerful Art she used
To be the first that should confirm her love
With prostitution of her virgin life.
But why for me? how poor they make me now,
That have betra'yd me to a debt the wealth
Of Saints (that are in kindness ever rich)
Is not of able value to discharge;
I love them both with equal flame, and I
Distinguish neithers beauty when compared;
It is virtue and remorse give Ladies emi∣nonce
In the severe discretion of my heart.
I want the wisdom how to love; but I
Am sure I find I love, and it is too much
Come sing; would music had the power to give
A life, as it hath had to move things dead.
O draw your Curtains and appear, Ere long, like sparks that upward fly,
We can but vainly say you were, So soon you'll vanish from the eye.
And in what Star we both shall find (For sure you can't divided be)
Is not to Lovers Art assigned, Twill puzzle wise Astrology.
Who is it that assumes the office of
The dying Swan? all Music now (me thinks)
Is obsequy, and he that fings should sing his death.
The gentle and most valiant Prince, bold Prospero.
And there behold the faithful Le∣onell.
O pardon me that I have kept my vow.
Brave youth! I prize thy truth great as thy love;
We now are marked here, and enclosed for death,
So you have all a blessed liberty.
A liberty? we are more bound than slaves unto
The unwieldy oar; like harnessed cattle in
A Teem, we draw a load of sorrow after us
That tires our strength.
There was no way but this
To keep you still among the living, who
Before endeavoured nobly to procure
Our freedom with your deaths; do not rapine
At destiny, all remedy is past.
A fatal truth; for we but now de∣jested on our knees
Did woo my Fathers mercy, and in vain.
Then strive not by untimely rage to help
And further our impossible release
With certain hazard of your selves; our last
Suit is, we may begin our willing death
As quietly as undisturbed sleep.
The silly crime of envy which un∣learned
And haughty Lovers use, I shall prevent;
You'll want the object now, that makes you interchange
The vexed remembrance of each others claim.
Were you to live we could not share that guilt;
Though number make us three, wise love hath given
Us all one peaceful heart.
O Melora! were it but timely now
To wish continuance of mortality,
Like them, we should not differ though the same
One virtue were our mutual hope and choice;
But you should chide her sir, for she hath loved
Your happiness too much, vainly to lose
Her life when mine would satisfy.
Why Melora did thou undo my soul
With so strange curtsy? but why did you
Evandra? stay, o stay, leave us not yet.
The Guard are entered here, and now the last
And shortest of our hours is come; fare∣well
Brave Prince; brave Lionel farewell; fare∣well brave Prospero.
The gentle valiant Prince
Farewell; and valiant Lionel farewell;
Farewell the hardy Prospero Ex. from above.
Nay, stir not Gentlemen, it is in vain,
They are beyond all humane help; would you
Scale heaven, and cool the saucy Sun with your
Frail breath when he doth scorch you with his beams?
For such is now the enterprise that strives
To rescue them from this high Fort.
Would I were in a Cannon charged, then straight
Shot out to batter it, and be no more.
Would all the stones might be or∣deigned my food
Till I could eat their passage out.
These angry exaltations show but poor.
Sir, whither shall we go?
To see them dye; but not like vain and choleric boys, to show
A fury that can hazard none but our
Disdained swords; yet still my worthy friends
There is an undertaking left, and such
As valiant lovers may perform; why should
The base and dirty Guard be honoured with
Our opposition or our blood? have we
Not grief enough to dye without their help?
Let us with fixed and watery eyes behold
These Ladies suffer, but with silence still,
Calmly like pinioned doves, and when we see
The fatal stroke is given, swell up our sad
And injured hearts until they break.
I do not find my self unapt for this.
My breast contains an angry lump that is
Too stubborn for a quiet bravery;
He that shall strike Evandras life shall feel
Me till he sink low as the hollowness where Devils dwell.
This way; let us avoid the gazing multitude.
Have you unto your Officers given charge
To guard the passage from the Fort unto
The Palace yard with bold well-govern'd men?
All is directed Sir as you command;
But for their government, if it be to be had
In prisons, galleys, or stews, you may
Trust them with a mutiny.
His resolution's fi'xd, and there re∣mains
No comfortable sign to flatter hope.
My Lords Ambassadors sit down; and though
You now behold a Prince that rather loves
To be thought cruel than to break his vow,
Do not believe to be severely just
Is tyranny; you shall have fair admit∣tance,
Yet your request unkindly ought to be
Denied; and though your Master (when the chance
Of war rendered my brother in his power)
Stole in the dark his noble life, and durst
Not give the wrathful act a general view;
I'm not ashamed to publish my revenge,
It shall be openly performed, to show
I not suspect men's censure or dislike.
Sir, he that ministers revenge may hurt
And damage others, but can bring no good
Or real profit to himself.
And with your Highness leave, we think it were
More wise to mulct our Masters treasure, which
Shall be exhausted freely to your own
Proportion and content, so you will take
His Daughter and her loved companion from
The danger of this day.
I will not sell my brothers blood;
The prisoners approach; make room; ere long
They shall enjoy the liberty of souls;
Vasco, lend me thine ear.
How beautiful is sorrow when it dwells
Within these Ladies eyes? so comely, that it makes
Felicity in others seem deformed.
I wish my patience may be strong enough.
I now begin to doubt I am not fit
To see their hazard and endured.
Nor I; my loyalty already stirred
Beyond the temperate suff'rance of a man.
Thou see the Prince wears trouble in his locks;
Though any opposition he can make
Be but impertinent and weak, yet charge
Thy Officers, if he endeavour to
Disturb my will, imprison him in the Fort.
I shall observe him Sir; I do not like
This employment; the Prince will find no
Enemies in all my tribe.
If you have any words from Millaine th•t
Imports their knowledge, ere they dye, be brief
My Lords Ambassadors; I give you leave
To whisper your affair, or if you please,
To make it public to the world.
Your cruel resolutions sir, have so
Confined our liberality, that all
We shall deliver to Evandra now
Is but her Fathers and her Countries tears,
And those we can by deputation pay
To the indang'ring of our eyes.
And to Melora, that in kindness thus
Hath shared her destiny, we do confer
The worlds eternal wonder and applause.
It will deprive me of some joy in death, to think
My Father needs must suffer by a vain
Unprofitable grief, and it is the last
Request I make, that he would wisely now
Forget my obsequies and name.
And my desires make suit, that those who shall
Hereafter write the business of this day
May not believe I suffer for the hope
Of glorious Fame, but for a secret in my hidden love.
Question your justice Sir, must they both dye?
Both; and I think my payment is but short,
When I consider well the measure of
My brothers worth, with their unvalued Sex,
And wish some man that boasts your masters blood
Were singly here to undergo their fate,
It would more pleasure my revenge, but since
There is no hope in that desire, away, lead them to death.
Stay Sir, reprieve them but one mi∣nuts space
Until you hear a stranger speak.
What means this noble youth?
Be sudden in thy speech, for my re∣avenge brooks no delay.
If I produce a man allied unto this Family you so abhor,
Great as your self in title and descent,
Will you with solemn vow confirm their liberty,
And take his life to satisfy your wrath?
By the honour of a Princes faith I will;
And such a miracle would ravish me.
I dare believe your vow, you were so just
Though cruel in your last, and know my joys
Must take the privilege to boast you now
Have lost the power to make them dye.
It shall be wonderful if that prove true.
I am not Lionel the Millaine Knight,
But Lionel the Duke of Parmas Son,
Heir to his fortune and his fame.
O Melora! thy brother will reveal
Himself and quite undo our glorious strife.
By this you find I am to Millaine near
Allied; but more to tempt your fury on
My life, know it was my valiant Father took
Your brother prisoner, and presented him
Where he received his death; my Father that
So oft hath humbled you in war, and made
His victories triumph almost upon
The ruins of your State.
So young, and filled with thoughts so excellent,
That they surprise my wonder more than love!
Well may thou worship, Prospero, but dare not envy him.
B'ing your Disciple Sir,
I'm better taught; but it is no crime to wish
Fortune had made me Heir of Parma and
Not him, then I had died for them.
This is some comfort yet; I'm for the Ladies.
But 'thath not given our sorrows a full cure.
Sir you are boldest with your self; but you
Shall see I need no provocation to
Observe my vow; unbind the Ladies there,
And bear him straight to death.
Stay Sir, he must not dye.
How? age and grief makes thee a fool, and mad.
He must not Sir, if your revenge be wise,
And fix your anger where it is most deserved;
Behold Millaine himself your Enemy;
Live princely youth, and let my years (which time
Would soon determine) be the ransom of
My chiefest blood; Evandra do not weep.
O Sir, there was less use of me; why would
You with this danger on your self destroy
That noble fame I virtuously pursued?
Our hope of endless glory now is lost.
Sure heaven intends more blessings to this day.
I have achieved my wishes in full height;
This was a justice sir, more than I could
Expect from my own Stars; free Lionel
And let him suffer the prepared stroke.
First hear me speak, and fir how ever you'll
Interpret the discretion of my words
I am resolved he shall not dye, nor none
Of these, though all in your command and power.
Say thou so old Shaver? make but that good,
The maids of Savoy shall everlastingly
Pay thee tribute in dainty gloves and Nose∣gays
To stick in thy girdle.
This were a mystery would please in∣deed.
Look on me well: I am your bro∣there Sir;
And though ten years I have been hidden from
Your sight, this noble Duke hath used me so,
I cannot call it banishment, but the
Retired and quiet happiness of life.
How wisely have the heavens con∣triv'd this joy!
And though his fortune in the war, which made
Your Armies ever flourish with success,
Taught me prevent my Countries ruin by
Detaining him from your employment there,
Yet he enjoyed all the delights that solitude
Affords: and when he chose his happiness
In Books and deep Discourses of the learned,
I searched the most remote and knowing world
For men to furnish his desires.
It is acknowledged sir, and with a bounteous thanks.
How welcome are these miracles? let me
Embrace thee as the greatest joy that since
My birth I have received. O my loved bro∣there,
Thou see though absent I've been faithful to
Thy virtues, and thy memory.
But sir, too strict a master of your vow;
Yet tic a fault my gratitude should more
Admire with thankfulness, than chide.
This happy day deserves a place su∣preme
And eminent in the Calendar.
First I will give into your cour∣teous arms
The Duke of Millaine sir, good &amp; renowned;
And now the bold and princely Lionel;
Then Alvaro my honoured nephew that
Deserves the best of humane praise and love.
Dread sir, that every one may share the joy
And blessings of this precious hour, let me
Restore poor Prospero into your breast.
He shall bee cherished and his faults forgiven.
I shall deserve it sir in future deeds
Of honour, and of loyal faith; how I
Am raped to see those wonders strangely thrive?
What think you of the stars now Caladine?
Doe these small twinkling Gentlewomen
Look to their business well? have they a care of us?
It is beyond our merit or our hope.
Isle buy me an optic, study Astro∣logie,
And visit i'm every fair night ore my house leds.
The chiefest happiness of virtue is
Th'increase, which to procure, with Hymens help
We'll knit, and intermingle lovers hearts.
Come my Alvaro, Isle bestow thee straight.
A little patience sir, and hear me speak
Before you give what lawfully is mine.
Indeed thou dost deserve him by thy love.
In love Evandras interest justly
Doth equal mine, but I appeal unto
His vow, which sure her goodness will as∣sist.
And my religion shall persuade me keep;
But where (Melora) was it made?
Within my fathers court, when five years since
(Disguised you stole to see a triumph there)
You promised if our houses enmity
Were ever reconciled, the church should join our hands.
Sir, What my sister speaks I'm wit∣ness to,
And hope this day shall end our parents strife
In a kind peace.
Which thus I doe confirm;
Take him Melora, with him all the joys
Thy virtues or our prayers can procure.
Did thou for this with kind Evan∣dra strive
Who should encounter danger first? al∣though
Thy beauty's changed, it is not lost; I now
Remember thee, and my vows prophecy.
Now my best Evandra give me thy hand;
And hear receive it valiant Lionel;
That I may ratify the faith I gave,
If ere this war expired she should be thine.
Then hee may challenge present interest,
For we may meet to hear voices and lutes,
But never more the angry Drum.
Alvaro's virtues sir, and yours, have both
An equal claim; persons I ne'er admired
So much to make a difference in my choice;
Therefore my fathers promise, and my love
Have made me yours.
I am orecharg'd with my felicity.
To Evandra, gladness be still renewed,
Who since I see so worthily bestowed,
My love is quieted in everlasting rest.
And mine by your exact, and perfect choice.
These glad archievements are so well deserved,
I not malign your loyes; Isle to the war
And fight to win you a perpetual peace.
I'm bold to crave acquaintance with your grace,
And to begin it with a suit.
It shall be granted Sir.
I have married your Graces Country∣woman,
And was a little (sir) mistaken in her age,
Would you'd procure us a divorce.
If you can maked appear she is too old.
She writes a hundred and ten (Sir) next grass.
It is a fair age; well Sir, you shall have a divorce,
And what the profits of her dowry would
Have been, I will my self bestow on you.
Such another good day makes us all mad.
Come, to the Temple, and let's join those hearts.
That with such pious courage have endured
The trial of a noble constant faith,
Whom tortures nor the frowns of death could move.
This happy day we'll consecrate to love.
But that the Tyrant custom bears such sway,
We would present no Prologue to our Play,
Since we have learned in Prologues all the scope
Is with weak words to strengthen weaker hope,
When with sad solemn phrase we court each ear
Not to observe, but pardon what you hear:
Or if there were but one so strangely wise
Whose judgement strives to please, and trust his
Him at an easy charge we could provoke (eyes,
To a kind doom with this grave long old cloak.
Now for the over-subtle few, who raise
Themselves a trivial fame by a dispraise,
Our bold opinion is, they may descry
Some easy wit, but much more cruelty.
Troth Gentlemen you must vouchsafe a while
To excuse my mirth, I cannot choose but smile,
And it is to think, how like a subtle spy
Our Poet waits below to hear his destiny;
Just in the Entry as you pass, the place
Where first you mention your dislike or grace:
Pray whisper softly that he may not hear,
Or else such words as shall not blast his ear.

COurt'ous spectators, you must know that he
Who is the writer of this Tragedy.
Was actor and spectator in it: who means,
Here to present it into Acts and Scaenes:
If you are pleased with truth, the storie's true,
And if with novelties, the subject's new,
If wonders do delight ye: on this Stage
Octet's the greatest wonder of our age.
Or if you're pleased with seasonable things,
Here's fightings twixt the people and their Kings.
Or if sad melancholy hath you sent
Hither for pastime, here is merriment.
And if truth, wonder, novelties, mirth, season
Do not content you, sirs, you have no reason.
I Shall not be able to get into any Cell: such another fit of drow∣sinesse fell upon me, when I saw the Vision of the Sun, which the most Catholic King wears for his Crest, run back so many de∣grees—then was I—as I am now—ready to drop down with heaviness: he that cannot hold up any longer, must needs lie down.
This is the state of Kingly Glory,
Kings they are but transitory:
Beggars they ascend the Throne,
Vengeance light on every one.
They w'had all things at their beck,
Here they ride, and break their neck.
Rise, O King, and ne'er relent,
Here's a Throne from Heaven sent;
With a Sceptre, Crown and Ball;
Longest Liver must take all.
Abundant riches shall shower down:
Then go fetch another Crown.
Post tempestatem tranquillitas, After a storm comes a calm; first, famine and fury; then, plenty and riches. This was not revealed un∣to me, but for some use that I should make thereof: What though Spain contemn my warnings, it may be Naples will not: if I can do any good, then—so: if not—so, so.
I've given you instructions; which if you follow, the Town's ours.
Worthy Patron, this bulk and vessel of mine, shall strike, or hoize up sail, or tack about, agreeable to the wind of your words; and steer accordingly, and employ all her Oars, to further what you breathe. Provided al∣ways, that what you advise, be still for the good of the Republique. O the dear people of God, the too too much abused people, they shall never want my pains and best endeavours to do them good.
About it then, Talk is but talk, it is money buys land; wit commands money; discretion governs wit; expedition is the life of action, but delays are dangerous.
About, say you? why I'll run or fly
To serve the Popolo, I'll live, I'll die.
So: if my Engine holds, I'll batter the lofty
 Tower, that so much threatens depopulations; and level the high walls of Government, with the earth they stood upon: The Axe is already laid to the root of that aspiring Tree, that used such droppings on those under-succours, that they could neither rise, nor grow, and spreads her flourishing leaves at such a breadth, that her head cannot perceive the strokes she now re∣ceives, even at her root, till down she false, that all her Royal Branches lye like sprey upon the ground: I've found a fit subject for to work upon: the man is bold and resolute, active and quick of apprehen∣zion; and prodigies run still along with his express∣once: The several opinions which the world conceives of the simplicity of this poor Fisher-man, shall serve for light and ayeriall corks, whilst the profound and weighty principles, wherewith I have instructed him, shall serve for so many leads and plummers to that net, that shall take whole draughts of Politicians; that shall drive them from swimming in their deeps, and force them to such exigents, that the most contemptible and mean hands, shall take them in their shallows: and well ye have deserved it, ye ear-wigs to Kings; you that think the Sacred Unction not sufficient to anoint your King, except it mingled with the peoples tears.
It is you that crown the Royal Temples with Thorns instead of Gold, and put Reeds into their hands instead of Scepters: It is you that have brought the people from feeding on the food that was ordained by God, to live on fruit ordained by you: And yet not resting there, you have put Excise on that: And worse then Catterpil∣lars, who only were devourers of the fruit upon their trees; ye'have crept into the poor man's basket, and eat a third part of every apple out of the childrens hands: And when I withstood these impositions, as my place and duty bound me, with all the pressing arguments of pity and compassion: As if my words were charms,
 they stopped their ears, like Adders; and I, for my piety and good advice, was sent to Spain, upon an honourable Embassy, to carry Beleropho his Letters: which lodged me in the dungeon; so that 500 leagues, and more, I was forced to carry mine own prison, and a Letter, whose lines were all as strong as Irons. But now I'm here ready to act the sweetest of all sins, revenge: Nor will I let it fall like rain upon them, or distill my fury drop by drop, but I will pour my anger forth.
For all is now at stake; the Die is cast:
I'expect my chance; the Rubicon is past.
One and all, one and all, one and all, &amp;c.
My Masters, now we are full-bodied, let us choose a Head, otherwise we shall be subject to confuse∣on; and no man knows what to do, or whom to obey.
A Massenello, A Massenello, A Massenello, &amp;c.
Tomaso Amello di Malfa, General of the Neopolitanes.
What means this Tumult? Wherefore are these stirs? For what's this insurrection? How occasioned is this commotion? My Masters, if from the Excise, that is on fruit your discontents arise, I'll undertake
 to ease all your grievances, satisfy all your desires: Let me suffer, let my Wife and Children be sacrifices for the peoples good, if I procure not this good unto the peo∣ple: Let my house, and all within it, suffer in the just flames of your high insensments, if I do not procure you all the contentment that your hearts can wish: Only be satisfied for the present, till satisfaction for the future may be had; which may be no less welcome unto you, then peaceable unto all.
Don Eletto di popolo, In answer to your grave and learned speech; you must know, that the horse now knows his own strength, and is beholding to you for his understanding, and will not answer your switch and spur so readily as he was wont: they will not take it at your hands, nor at your heels, as heretofore; they will not be rid off their legs, nor out of wind, by every hot spur; Apes must not think to ride fierce Mastiffs, and box them into conformity, now the muzzle's off.
Sir, in a word, our pressures were intolerable; and when the Asse's back is broke, it is time to take off the burden. Our resolution's this; We will not have the lesser rule the greater strength, nor the fewer rule the multitude, nor one rule all; and that's our resolute∣on.
Noble Sir—
Noble Fool: dost thou think to catch Tomaso with thy courtly terms?
He prates, he prates, we have had enough of this, prating, we will have no more prating.
Andiamo.
Viva Massenello, vi•a, viva, Massenello
MY Lord, I pray you let me peruse the Letter over again—must? the command is perem∣ptory: I would to God, that when they send such musty Letters out of Spain, for such large sums after sums of mo∣ney, they would be pleased to direct us ways how we must come by them.
And't please your Majesty, the Excise that's laid on fruit, brings money in apace, and the tax is sure and constant; and a sum of money that will strike a great stroke into the sum that is demanded, may be advanced out of that, if it so like your Majesty.
How great sums of money out of that? Poor people! how they shrink under the burden we are sourced to lay upon them: And having laid Excise on all things upon earth, on fire, in water, the people fly to see what immunities there are in air, and seek for pri∣viledges in the tops of trees; and how they may make free meals upon their fruit: but cruelty hath cast up such a trench, whose quick-sets are now grown so high, that they have now (even) enclosed the com∣mon air.
Good your Majesty, be not pleased to aggravate too much the hardness either of your own, or their con∣dition; no Kingdom wherein the people in their several degrees live more happily, then in this flourishing King∣doom of NAPLES, and under your Government: Whereon it stands, like a Mountain, firm upon its basis. Are not the Laws duly executed? Do not the No∣bility live in a most splendid and glorious equipage? The Gentry in a most illustrious and seemly deco∣rum? But as for this same Popolo, this profanum vul∣gus,
 this bellua mortuorum capitum, these Bores, Peasants and Commons, Goodman and Gaffers, their backs were made for burdens, and their hands for labour: How will you make your sauces, if you will not squeeze your Oran∣ges? Or Wine, if you will not press the Grape? How shall the King of Spain's Soldiers eat bread, if you will not tread the Corn out of the straw? Nature never in∣tended, that the Ass should be stall-fed: nor did you e∣ver hear of such creatures pampered up, till they were provender-prickt—
Come, come my Lord Controller, this is not well to pick thanks from some one or two, you draw upon your head the curses of a multitude; and to please some one, you care not though you displease all: but we have too many such now adays, it would be better if it were otherwise.
Lord Chamberlain, I envy not your Lordship's popularity, which I never esteemed otherwise then a sea∣there in a fool's cap.
My Lord, you said too much; if you do not understand your self, I do; if you have forgotten in whose presence you are, I have not: However, this I shall be bold to tell your Lordship, though it be in the Kings hey∣ring, though you have put the Ass upon the people, you shall not put the fool on me. Had we always day, we had need of no other Favours, but the Suns: but seeing we have as many nights, we stand in need of smaller lights; that favour doth not always last.
And against the favour sets, which light debars;
I'll think of being beholding to the stars.
Good night to your Lordship.
My Lord, you did not well: I do not like these janglings, they bode mischief, they portend no good:
 my mind presages evil; and these quarrellings are a bad Omen, and put me in mind of a scurvy dream I dream't last night. Methought I was in Spain, hunting the Taro; and whilst I was ready for the encounter, the furious beast made at me with more heads then had Briarius hands; and methought looking how, and where to charge, stan∣ding near unto a Poplar tree, the wind blew the falling leaves so thick into my face, that I could neither see, nor breath; so that the furious beast bare me to the ground: whereupon I awaked, and found my self in the jaws both of danger and dishonour.
The news, my Lord? Heaven defend us; their looks speak nothing but distraction and horror: speak out, my Lord, what's the matter?
I met with the Eletto di popolo; here, let him tell his own tale.
O Sir, all the City is risen, commotions are in every part thereof, and the insurrection grows higher and higher.
Now my dream is out: silence: go speedily, and from me, assure them of all the satisfaction can be given them.
I have done it already.
You did not do it from me?
I have, my Liege.
Do it again.
I have engaged my life, the lives of my Wife and Children, and all I have, and they will not hear a word: they say, you have broken your promise with them so oft, that they will not believe a word you say, or what is said in your behalf.
Away, make hast, run, fly, tell them, swear, protest, call God to witness, that I intend it, and
 that you know my intentions to be such, as will give them satisfaction, not only in this, but in more then they desire.
I'll go; but God bless me, for I fear Hel's broke loose.
Now, my Lord, Sunshine: how goes the day by your Clock?
Marry I think it is almost upon the stroke of twelve.
You shall hear it strike one by and by.
One and twenty, with all my heart, and we may but strike a fast as they. Sir. what will you do? Will you, that I gather strength? and we will crush this Cocka∣trice in the egg, and destroy the Monster, whilst the Dam is in her labour: I'll be the Midwife that shall welcome it by peace meals into the world.
The King is wiser, or I could wish he were.
My Lord, It is not long since your Lordship told me, that the Kingdoms Government stood firm, as doth a Mountain, on its Balance; but now it can be compared to no Mountain, except Vesuvias, whose flames do run a head, whose big swollen breast vomits out sulphurs more prodigious then that: NAPLES was then pre∣served from that eruption, by a contrary wind; and so it must be now too, what you breath, or others may be plea∣sed to think, as a present remedy, Nec vult panthera do∣mari, the people will not, like a Town-top, fall asleep with scourging: I have seen an unruly horse, when all harsh means could not prevail, stand still with stroking: I'll try that way; when I grant them all, they can ask no more.
Sir, they will not be satisfied with all you grant, except you will grant your self to be no∣thing.
I'll warrant you; I have sent unto them, and you
 shall hear they will be satisfied: they are men, and men have reason, and reason will tell them when they are well.
I tell you, Sir, they are men, and men of reason, yet injured men; and there are Devils amongst those men; who laying hold upon the peoples former discon∣tents, sow such fears and jealousies in the hearts of the people, that nothing shall satisfy, till they have brought their Devilish, and so long hatched design, to some effect▪
O Sir, the people are all mad, and both their mad∣ness and themselves increase: they would not hear the Eletto di popolo, but offered violence to his person: so that he is hardly escaped, if he be escaped at all, and they are all marching towards the Palace.
Go, give command the Palace be well guarded: What a tempest is here all upon the sud∣den?
O, are you advised of that now? pray God it be n't too late.
O thou Angel guardian! lead me by the hand, through this Wilderness of wild beasts and amazes, whose intricate, and so difficult windings, are never to be found out, but by the highest providence, and your assistance, keep my senses from distraction, and let no fear out my reason from its proper office.
O Sir, you are betrayed by your own Guard, who most cowardly and traitorously, upon the ap∣proach of the rabble, have put out all their matches, and turned the muzzles of their muskets downwards, and stood like so many senseless statues, as if every soul had suffered an Eclipse, whilst the rout entered the
 gates; and possessed themselves of the Palace.
Base mongrel curs: have they taught their musket-barrels to submit to Canes? and have their chines of beef bred no better spirits in the blood within their veins, then to give way to apple-feeders? Dumb dogs! could they neither bark, nor bite?
Sir, it is no time to expostulate, but to save your self.
Save my self: from whom? From Apple-parings? From men whose veins are filed with nothing but the juice of Plums? Shall the Sceptre submit to a comp∣ny of Reeds? I, I, be gon, be gon; see how the wind blows chafe away: though none stood to me, I should think my self as strongly armed as Jove, that holds thun∣der enough in one hand, to frighten a world of men.
Sir, What do you mean? Your Friends have all left you, you are alone.
No, thou art here, my Friend Mon••lto; they were never Friends of mine; for Friends would never leave me thus. O adversity! thou touchstone of men's hearts; I see thou art good for something; forsaken of all; power is fallen to the ground, and no advice remains to help it up: experience, you are come too late to tell me, that,
That Prince his Throne is staid up but in parts,
That i'n't supported by the peoples hearts.
Stand: what would you have?
Silkworm: put up thy Sword: offer but to re∣sist us in the least degree, or to disobey us but in a tittle, and thou had as good eat thunder, or engage lightning within thy bosom, instead of air: Whore's the Vice-King?
I do not know; or if I did, I would not tel you.
Divide your selves, and search the King there, whilst we search here.
1. Hold; let's bring him to the Mercato; and what we do, do there in the sight of all the people.
2. Will it please your Majesty to give me leave to take you by the collar?
3. And I to take you by the locks?
4. Come along, Jackanapes with a Whim-wham.
Viva il popolo, viva, viva, &amp;c.
What's the matter?
We have found him, we have found him, here he is.
Where? Where is he? Where is the Vice-Roy? What's become of him? Have you lost him? Who had him? No man speak? What's that you were scuffling for? Chikeens? How came they to be thrown amongst you?
The King threw them.
Capitra! Was there ever known such fools, to grasp at shadows, and to lose the substance thus? You all show your selves to be what you are, and not men like∣lie to go through with such a work. I hope you see your er∣roar now: and that it may be so no more, seeing you have
 made me your General, I pronounce it death, hence∣forth, for any man to keep or preserve any thing, that is the estate of any Delinquent whatsoever, be they Chariots or Horses, Pearls or precious Stones, Cloths of Gold or Silver, but let them all burn, and let Delinquents Thou∣ses be fuel for Delinquents goods; that all the World may know, we have not enterprised this business to enrich our selves, but to vindicate the common liberty: Death and damnation be his lot, that dares transgress a tittle of that which I command.
That all the World may know our equity,
Were he ten thousand Brothers, he should die.
Viva, viva, viva, &amp;c.
Whore's the Captain of the Castle?
Here.
Make hast, and call the Soldiers together, man your Walls, draw up your Bridges, load your Cannon, charge your Muskets, light your Matches, beat your Drums, call to the Parade, Hel's broke loose, and the Devil leads the dance: O, I fear me, the Vice▪Roy hath suffered already in this tumult.
No, hoe's safe as yet, though seized upon by the rudest hands, at a dead lift: the Vice-Roy turned Con∣juror, cast a golden apparition before their eyes, and so escaped their clutches.
How Conjurer? What golden apparition? Prithee do not trifle with us now: Whore's the King? What's become of him?
He is safely housed in the next Convent, where, if you send (presently) but the smallest guard, to prevent the worst; they knowing not what is become of him, you may easily conduct him to this Castle.
Captain, make all the hast you can, with what Guard is next at hand, and guard the Vice-Roy hi∣there.
It shall be done.
QƲem queritis adsum?
My Lord the King, welcome, as is Eli∣zeum, to a new come soul: how escaped your Majesty?
As a bird out of the snare, or as a brand out of the fire, engaged by the hairs, both of my head and beard, hands laid hold upon my collar, and no part of my body unseas'd on.
Strange outrage! and unheard of insolence! how got you loose?
I showered down gold upon their heads, which loosed their hands: so that whilst they were scrambling for the money, I escaped to the next Convent, and so hither: This is the habit of Father Anthony, that holy man, whom I found there; having purposely left the Woods to fore∣warn me of this mischief, but happened to come in the very action, followed me into the Convent, bad me be of good comfort; told me, that all should have a happy en∣ding; would not let me stay for any convoy, but put his habit upon me, wherewith I passed (unsuspected) through the thickest of them: This, I am sure, is well, and the other course might not have been so fortunate.
Happy day, and a good presage of future happi∣ness, and prosperous success.
Sir, I am over-joyed to see you here, and alive:
 but I wish that I could say, safe, and out of danger; for the place neither assures the one, nor makes you safe from t'other: I have been viewing the provisions and Ammunition of the Castle, and I find neither Am∣munition for a days fight, nor provision for a months continuance.
Captain of the Castle: how do you answer this?
Sir, I can sooner give to your Majesty an answer, then a remedy. Sir, besides my often solicitations of those whom it did concern; here are my Copies of Petitions to your Majesty for both, after months upon months de∣lays; here are my assignments for so much bullet, powder, corn and beef, wine and oil; here are the Copies of Or∣ders to the contrary; so much of this and that for Spain; so much provision and ammunition for the Galleys; so ma∣ny quarters of wheat to be sent to Genoa, to make mo∣ney; sum totalis, nothing for me. Sir, if any of all these things had grown within the Castle, I would have been an∣swerable for the want thereof: but since they do not, but must be otherwise had, I doing my endeavour, and all would not do, I hope your Majesty will hold me excused, and lay the blame on those who worthily deserve it.
O miserable state of Princes! When
They are forced to see with th'eies of other men.
This is no time to think of what is past, but how we may help our selves out of the present plunge we are in: they are our Masters now, and there is no wrestling without hands.
Lord Duke, you are a man in some favour with the people, and may happily do good service at this time; it would be very acceptable, if you could do any thing to appease this uproar.
Sir, I understand, that nothing will satisfy them now, but the privileges granted unto them by the
 Emperor Ferdinand, and ratified by Carolo quinto.
You may make them believe privileges of les∣ser moment, to be the same; and it is all one to them.
Lord Card: If I should demand the same privy∣ledges which they require, interpretation might make me guilty of a crime as black as theirs: And if I should go about to delude them with privileges, which are not the same, and they find it out, I should run my self upon the fury of a multitude.
My Masters, we have nothing left us now, but every man a head; which that he may keep upon his shoulders, he must make use of his brains; for ought that I can hear, they carry their business warily; their pro∣ceedings speak order and method; contrivement go along with their design: Believe it, the progress they have made already, discovers a head, above a vulgar capacity; and the beast, as he goes along, shows, though many heads, yet one above the rest, by whom all are directed: So that Monarchy it self is opposed by that of its own nature; and we must play with them now at their own Weapons.
And where the Lion's skin doth fail,
We'll piece it with the Foxes tail.
My Lord Duke, you have a wild Brother, Don Pap di Caraffa, who we hear is very great with Peroon, Captain of the Bandittoes; so that by your means, he, and all his Associates, may be drawn to our part, and every one of those is worth a hundred door-keepers: And what do ye lack? Let us call them in: yet so, as they first offer their service unto the people, and so possess themselves of the heart of the City: then shall you go with these pretended privileges; and if they take, the business is ended: if not, you have so many servants at your elbow, ready to defend you, and to bring you off.
Excellently well advised: we thank you for your good advice.
It was spoke like a Cardinal, and they are the men now adays, who have engrossed the exaltations of Kingdoms to themselves, and have appropriated those re∣nowned acts unto their own order.
Let the Queen be taught to act her part too, and to go to Massenello's Mother, Wife and Daughters, and col∣logue and cog with them.
To stoop to our necessities, is Wisdom sed:
For when the Sun courts Dunghills, there are Serpents bred.
Come, let's about it then, and leave no stone unturned, where under may be found our looked for safety: truly they were much to blame,
Who put us thus to play the after game.
SIR, I must tell you here, in the presence of your Mother, your Wife, and Daughters here likewise, that you are much to be blamed; you have committed more goods and monies-worth unto the fire, out of mere vain-glory and ostentation, then would have made you the wealthiest man in the whole Kingdom of NAPLES, and so consequently the wisest, the greatest, the best, the noblest of all the Neopolitans: for wherein is wise∣doom most exercised? Then, in the gaining of that which hath the unquestionable command of all things, and that's money: so far I'm right. 2. For greatness: Who is great (I pray) but he that hath the world at will? And who's that? but he that hath money at command. Now for goodness: Ʋnde derivatur goodness? Goodness, quasi a nest of goods: get but that, and ye are good e∣nough. And Lastly, for Nobility: What is Nobility, but ancient riches? Get good store of old gold, it's no mat∣la whose it is, and search for bags that have not seen
 the Sun this many a day, and then you have ancient riches, and so consequently nobility. Sir, I beseech you to take the advice of him by whose direction you have prospered hitherto: do not so vainly reject and consume that, which is only able to preserve you from oblivion; Palms and Laurels wither in the hands, and on the heads of those who wear them, but riches embalms a Worthies memory more precious then any statues of brass or marble; and give him a more lasting fame then a memory that's preserved from oblivion by thin paper-wals.
Were I in your condition, the first thing Iw'd do, should be to build my self a house, for the honour of my name: then I would so feather my nest, that Jupiters own Bird, who builds his nest in the Sun, should not think it a disparagement to seek alliance with one of my Chikeens.
Genuino, thou hast converted me, henceforth I will be covetous, high minded, glorious and haughty: and hearken to what I shall say, in order to my conversion. Genuino, the City is rich, we have the power in our hands, why should we not have the riches? The Citizens begin to thrust their thumbs under their girdles, and to make pauses at our demands, and some of them begin to look acquaint already upon our actions: Hast thou not observed it, Genuino? Genuino, thou hast spoken wisely, money is all in all, and that's the thing we aim at; money is the sinews of War, and the life-bloud to action: let us suck this blood, and cut these sinews, lest they stand upon their terms with us: It is requisite that so strong a body should be thus enfeebled, when we know not how long they will take our part: let us but get a world of money, and we care not for the World. Pecunia is the Queen Regent of the Worlds Empire, whose devil jussements being so slenderly regarded, hath been the only cause, why none hath hitherto attained to the Quintessential and fifth Mo∣narchy. And therefore Dame Nature was wisely prove∣dent,
 in hiding with her greatest care, this thing Omni∣potent, in the very bowels of the earth; like a careful Mother, who hides her knives out of her childrens way, till they know how to use them: But we are men, and know full well how to be our own carvers: Let us pro∣vide our selves with these necessaries, and none shall live, but such as are beholding to us for doles of meat, and shives of bread: Money will ransom Kings, and make Crowns to pawn their Jewels: Therefore good Genuino, let us have money enough, the City has it: we have the City, and why should we be without it?
Softly, great Tomaso, you are too apt a Scholar; all that you have said is truth, and must be executed: yet so, as that they may seem to enjoy what we are Masters of: Let them be your Cash-keepers, and you shall command whatsoever they have, as readily, as if they were your Ser∣vents: Now you have made your self their Conqueror, you must not plunder the City, nor take all away at once; for if you do not leave a nest-egge behind you, the hens will lay no more: What's theirs by providence, must be ours with prudence: We will make them give, or we will use them, as the old Wives use their cakes, when they are grown dry, put them under ground.
Genuino, thou say well; of all Nations, sools have the least wit; and of all wise men, thou art one for my money.
Sir, you were pleased to talk of alliance even now; I forgot to tell you, that the Vice-Queen was here, and said, that her eldest Son should many one of your Daughters, if you will be friends with him.
A pox consound her for an Hypocrite; she came to abuse us, to flout and jeer us: a likely mat∣la.
Not so, carry your business handsomely, and he shall be glad to seek it: Where, in all the Royal Palace, is there a prettier Moppet then this same? A wittier
 thing? I tell you, Sir, she is a Bed-fellow for a Prince, and a Companion for his betters.
What she? marry come up; a blister on the tongue that spake it.
What say you to this girl? She's black, but lovely: If you can force him to any, you may compel him to accept of this; if he may choose, he will choose nei∣there.
I may do so, but I may choose: if you shackle Princes, you must have golden bonds, not rusty iron.
Come Genuino, we'll go and advise about the premises, leave foolish Women to themselves.
Am I but rusty iron? I think my self to be as good metal as her self: It was a roguish speech.
O Child, remember he is your Father.
My Father? What of that? Let him use me like a Child, I am no rusty piece.
As rusty as thou art, he shall thee, or none: let them consult out, as they please, it is your fine face that is the cause of all this stir.
Mother, I never thought it fine; but as it is, God bestowed it, and I hope you will not make Gods gifts my fault.
Go, go, you're a prating baggage.
Good Mother, do not build your discontents upon imaginations so improbable, and unlikely.
Improbable to thee, vile Wretch! but not to her.
I tell you, Sir, you must not do things rashly; take advice: Where have you a King? But such a one is his right hand: Be advised, Sir, Gods themselves did sit in Council.
I tell thee man, thou shalt be my right hand,
 and my right foot, and my right eye, and my right ear, and my right, right, right, any thing, if thou wilt be quiet: thou shalt be my chief Secretary, and Councellor of State; you shall be a Queen Mother, you a Queen; and thou, my little Chuck, the new Infant of Neapolis. I fear nothing, but that I shall want Children, and Kindred, ra∣there then honours and preferments to confer upon them.
Sir, they all expect you in the Mercato, nothing can be done until you come.
You may be sure of that: Who dares act any thing without you? You are the soul that gives life to the body politic, and the main Engine from whom the wheel of fortune borrows its motion.
It is well done of you, thus to let us understand our self.
I remember, when he was but a boy, many a time and oft, when he came home from fishing, he would commend the policy of the Herring, that could make themselves Kings, by their multitudes, notwithstanding the greatness of the Whale, and other Fishes: and when I was with Child with him, I dreamed that I was delivered of a son, who as soon as ever he was born, could stand up∣on his head.
Mother, I can easily interpret that dream for you; the King is the Head of the People, my Husband shall pull down the King, and bring him under his foot, and so stand upon his Head.
It is very likely to be true: a very pretty in∣terr rotation.
I, but Sister, this should have been done as soon as he was born: for so my Grandmother dreamed.
Goodly, goodly: how you come in with your five eggs a penny, and four of them rotten? The rising of the people was the big swollen belly, that contained the bully lad, that should do such feats: and my Father is not two days old, since he was so born.
I, but Sister, my Grandmother says, she dreamed how that my Father, as soon as he was born, should stand upon his head; if he stood upon his head, then his feet must be uppermost: how could he tread the King (then) under foot, when he stood upon his head?
Why, that may very well be, too—
I, just as you took shipping to go for Turkie, so I lent you my horse, and you went to Rome.
Vile Baggage! she's always crossing her Sister, and chopping of Logic with her; I'll chop you:
 Take that for your labour.
How shall I do, to let my Mother in law, and my Sister know, I have no such ambition, as they think in me, and have themselves? I would I could as well clear their bosoms from those suspicions, as well as I can my own from such vain hopes: they are all fired with that, which warms not me: My Grandmother is high-minded; my Father higher; my Mother highest; my Sister high∣est of all.
And since there's no degree in height for me, I'll stick unto my old humility.
An't please your Excellence, here is a Catalogue of the Delinquents names.
Have you taken examinations duly and truly? for
 I will do nothing but justice, all those (let me see your pen) before whose name you find this mark.
You understand me, the words out; and see that there be Commissioners appointed to take an Inventory of their goods, and be accomprable to us therefore.
Sir, The Bandits are come faithfully, and accor∣ding unto promise: Peroon, their Chieftain; and Don Pap di Caraffa, Brother to the Duke of Mattal. desire audience.
Bring them in, they're welcome:
These are Blades indeed, that, if occasion serve, will show my Gallants School-play.
To the thrice worthy, Tomaso Amello di Malfa, General of the Neopolitans, are we come to offer our service.
And our lives to be sacrificed in the defence of the most worthy Tomaso, and the Popolo.
We accept your offer, and appoint your guard to our own person.
Trumpets sound.
What noise is that? Go know the cause.
I am not yet well acquainted with the language of Trum∣pers.
The Duke of Mattaloon desires audience and ad∣mittance to your Excellence.
Let him have his will, and we'll have ours.
Peace to this people, and happiness to Tomaso their General, as in the body natural, so in the politic; there are causes which turn the best blood into corrupt∣on; and against tumescency there are medicines to be used to keep the swelling down, and to hinder the corrupt humours from gathering to a head: if the of∣fects may cease by taking away their causes, I have brought you cure: behold all your desires are granted, here's what you ask.
Peruse them Gen: they did well to send your grace with them: for as nothing could have satisfied the people, but that which you have brought; so nothing could have been more satisfactory, then that they should be brought by you; a man whom the people always had a good opinion of.
Sir, hold, I pray, your commendations are too soon bestowed; these Writings are all counterseit, and not the privileges of Carolo quinto; upon my life they are.
Ho? Counterseit? My Lord, you have foresee∣ted your honour, and your honesty together; and what is more, our good opinion of you; and are indeed no better then a Traitor to your Country.
Sir—Sir—Sir—Peroo—Pap—can ye endure this insolence to be done to my person?
If that will not off, this will.
Guard the Duke, give the sign to the Castle for sallying out speedily.
And I'll regard ye, ye fine, politic, neat, facet∣os traitors: give the word there: bid them all make ready: on my soul, Mat. they shall carry thee marching over this full body of resolves; but I will intercept thy passage, which shall be as difficult for thee or them to do, as to march over Vesuvias head. Drums beat aloud and call, our men together; if we stand, we stand; &amp; if we fall, we fall.
Whore's this Villain?
Hold dog, I am Don Pap.
Thou art the man I looked for.
Dogstar where under I was born! What? Did the fates ordain me to be no better then a Sprat or Whi∣ting, to be thus taken by a Fisherman? Yet high and migh∣tie Prince, Tomaso, you must cast your net into the Sea once more; the Fish you looked for, is not caught:
And though I die, the fight this comfort gives, That by my blood and death, my Brother lives
To give thee thy due, Peppo, thou were it a brave Fellow, and it is pity but that thou had been an honest man: In all my life I never heard of a braver piece of ser∣vice: And to deal plainly, I was ashamed of the odds, seeing they have done their work: They fought like De∣vils, or like men weary of living; they reached him into the Castle, as if it had been with a hand stretched through a Cloud; and they did it with so much ease, as if so many Sun-beams had made their way through a contrary wind. When they made a stand, they stood like a stretched out
 Rock against an Ocean, bidding defiance to all its Waves: And when they made their way through us, they passed like a fierce wind over the heads of corn; then wheeled about, like a Whirlwind, which raised not dust, but a smoke so big bellied wi•h fire and thunder, as with the blind thereof they conveyed this Mattaloon safe into the Castle; whilst some few and inconsiderable (O had we known it) made good the rear with a stand of fifteen naked breasts, against the power of NAPLES, until called off by order: then made their retreat as orderly, leaving a Bar∣ricado between them and us, only of the smoke of po∣der; which with much difficulty, my fellow Cits and Chits got over, but too late to gain any thing, save only the sight of these brave men who did this act. Only here Don Pap lies, who rather fell into, then by my hands; and, cursed be the rage, and madness, mingled with my shame, that coloured my sword with any of his blood: But I think I rather put him out of pain, then rid of his life: Yes, it was so, mortally shot through the back.
 Well Pap, though thou were mine Enemy, yet I will erect thee a Monument: Death discharges all enmity, and had thou lived, I had doubted the success: But
As for the rest, I make but even a scoff:
The body's soon dissected, when the head is off.
HAc non successit alia aggrediemur via: we must tack about again, and take another compass, before we can arrive at our wished point.
Wished point, do ye call it? The Devil himself would never wish for such a point, as I was like to find: the Devil a point was I likely to arrive at, but the point of death: if you have not better points then these, I will not give three pence a dozen for all the Points in your shop.
My Lord, it doth not become Nobility to seem frighted into so much choler: we admired your va∣lore, took notice of your service, and were about to give you thanks, had you not anticipated those thoughts which we were about to give breath unto.
When a man hath escaped hanging, I hope your Majesty will give a man leave to be merry after it; I made but a little bold with the Cardinal's language, but I am sure the Cardinal (a pox on his Rhetoric) had like to have been very bold with me: neither do I repent it, since your Majesty doth command me to be serious.
If it be so, my Lord, I am willingly mistaken.
If it were not so, I should willingly have given way to any passion my Lord should please to have been in; for losers should have leave to speak, and I'm sure he hath lost a Brother, whom we all shall miss as soon as he.
Could Heavens decree have been so satisfied, mine should have paid the ransom for his life; but let us fall to considerations, how we may preserve the lives that are left more considerable.
 Lord Cardinal, it is you must beat your brains, that must be the anvil whereon all our safeties must be wrought.
My Masters, we cannot expect otherwise then speedily to be besieged: if so, we must expect speedily to be brought to the several exigents of famine, and de∣speratenesse, with their Attendants, ruin and destructi∣on. A Castle without ammunition and provision, is like a Carcass that hath neither life nor soul; nay, like a Sche∣leton, that hath neither flesh nor blood; therefore these must be had: And for the effecting whereof, this is my advice; Let there be Letters devised to this purpose, that the French are upon the Sea with a great Fleet, and that their design is against NAPLES.
These Letters must be so ordered, as that they may be intercepted by the way: then if this take, and we find them sensible of the danger, you shall entreat Massenello to accept the office of General of all the Forces to be raised in the defence of the whole Kingdom. And to make this offer appear the more real, we will call upon all our loving Citizens to arm themselves (for the honour and safety of their Country) with what arms and ammunition they have need of, out of the Magazine; which is no more but what we can neither enjoy our selves, nor hen∣der them of: so shall we render our selves void of all suspicion; then shall we call upon them, as an act of the highest necessity, to provision and ammunition the Castle: Then send for Don John of Austria to come unto our re∣scue: so shall we furnish our selves with what is wanting; and by a fear of others, lull them into such security of us, that we may at leisure work all our ends both by Sea and Land, and so gain time, which is only able to restore us.
Your eminence speaks good advice.
This is not all, the Queen shall go on with her old instructions, bear him in hand, with the marriage of
 his Daughter; assure them all excise to be taken off: pro∣mise Mass. that a stately Monument shall be erected in the Mercato, containing all the articles of agreement between you and him, and hereby add such fuel to his proud fire;
That this detestable, and so accursed
Toad swells, and with his own poison bursts.
Lord Card. Your advice is so good and seaso∣noble, that it needs no debate, but execution; let it be done speedily, and use our authority therein as shall be requisite.
—Come, let us rise,
And reduce words to actions, then we're wise.
Where are you? haw!
Come, sit you down there, and you there, and you shall sit there: by the faith of my body you must take state upon you now: you must not think to do as you have done heretofore: and is it not time you should? Hath not your Son all? Hath not your Husband all? Hath not your and your Father all? Doth not the King, and the Lords, and all the Evil Councellors, hide themselves out of his sight? And doth not he command and rule all the people? Is not all at his disposing? If he bids take off a hundred heads, they must lose them: What shall I say more? In a word, he is all in all.
Nay, I am sure all this is true.
Then all is well.
All the better.
And I must have my all too. All is but vanity.
That was but a vain speech, Sister.
I have another all for you, then: All is not gold that glisters.
This girl is always crossing of her Sister: Vile Wretch!
Peace: how you two are always rangling and jangling: What? can't you agree when you have all be∣tween you? You should rather agree, and plot, and con∣trive how you may get a share in the Government; sure he will not refuse to hear his Mother speak, I •row; and he is a very unkind Husband, that will communicate his secrets unto his own Wife, and show all that he has unto the Wife that is in his bosom. Have not great Kingdoms been excellently governed by Women? And do you think that the Popedom it self could be so well ordered, if Don Olympia, like a good Huswife, did not keep the Keys? Come, come, if I were as you, I would see what becomes of all the Money, and all the Land, and all the Houses, and all the Household-stuff, that is confiscated; I would see, which way it went, and how it was disposed, and to what end and uses, that I would.
Indeed I could wish, that my Son would be ruled a little.
Mother, he must, and shall: What not hear his nearest and dearest Friend speak? And when it is for his own good? Who should he hear?
Mother, your pardon a little: Wife I pray ex∣cuse me, I am very busy.
What would you peruse—
No, no, you know I have done with the Land and Houses; I would see what sums of money were ceased on to your use.
O here it is.
Read it.
Imprimis, Found in the Duk di Mat: his house, 60000 Spanish Pistols.
Item, in his Villa, 40000 Crowns.
Item, in Don Pap his house—
Don Diego Devil! how many millions is there in all? What? do you talk to me of Crowns and Pistols? Do you think that I have leisure to hear you prate of Crowns and Pistols?
Sir, there is eleven Millions in all.
So then, eleven Millions, that's something to the purpose, we'll divide it all amongst our selves; but I've given order that 200 houses be pulled down already in the Mercato, for the building of my self a Palace; and I allow four Millions out of this money towards the work; I com∣mand you see there be Workmen enough provided, that it may be built this Summer.
I pray, will you speak to him? He talks so extra∣vagantly, and doth such strange things, that I begin to fear him extremely: besides, he hath not slept a wink this four or five nights together.
Dear Son, I pray you, will you be ruled?
How? ruled by a Woman? Mother, I'll tell you a story, the glory of the English Nation and Sex: the Lady Ward was in hot pursuit of a new order of the Je∣suitesses, to be granted to her, and her Sisternity, by the last Pope; which not obtaining in his days, she renews her suit at the entrance of this present Pope into his reign; she makes her addresses, fortifies her desires with the most specious arguments; the Pope sends all his Card∣nils and Camarers out of the presence, pretends to trust her with the greatest secret in the world, such a one, as he would trust no man withal: whereupon his Holiness rises up, and fetches a little box, which he delivers unto her, desiring her but to keep it three days, and then to bring it unto him again; giving her a strict command, not to open it: she carries it home, her Sisters were impatient of being kept ignorant of what was therein contained; she pleads his commands to the contrary, they urge their Warrants of a Non-discovery:
 assuring her (undoubtedly) that whatsoever were in it, they would be sure to lay it up again, and wrap it as it was before; she yields to their temptations; the box is opened, nothing therein but a strange kind of fly, which got away, and could never be recovered, nor the like thereof: The time is come, when the box must be restored; not coming, she is sent for; sent for; comes; there was the box, but no fly; confusion of face, and distracted looks, was all her answer: Whereupon the Pope spake unto the Lady, as follows, Madam, Now you see your own error, and the frailty of all your Sex together: you desire, amongst the rest of your requests, that you would have me grant unto your Order, and to your Sex, viz: the power of hearing Confessions: So, saith he, I shall commit the affairs and secrets of the Christian World, to a thing, called Woman; who from first to the last, could never let alone so much as an Apple upon a Tree, or a Bee in a Box, but they must be med∣ling, though it were to save or confound the whole World: Therefore, Mother, I pray keep your rules to your self, for I do not mean to be ruled by any of you all.
What, not by me, who am the Wife in your bosom?
No forsooth: What? hear a rib prate?
O Lord! I would I had my old Husband a∣gain.
Why had thou ever any Husband before?
I mean, I would I had my Husband now of the old fashion, if honours have so changed his manners, that I must not speak to him.
I tell thee, Wife, when I was in case to do so, thou know I did it; I made thee privy, heretofore, to all the secret windings and turnings of my Net; and when the business was any thing intricate, you know I always called you forth to unfold the mystery, I called you ever and anon to dilate the business, and I always took your ad∣vice about the repairing and mending the breaches of that
 our Commonwealth; you had the fing'ring and ordering, not only of the light corks, but also of the most weighty plummets of our State; I acquainted you from day to day, how many prisoners I had taken, viz. so many Sprats, so many Whitings, so many Gudgeons, so many this, so many that, I with-held nothing from your knowledge; but now the hand of providence hath called me to hold the Scales of Justice; now, to be President of a Council of State; by and by, President of a Council of War: Do you think Women are sit Creatures to be consulted with? Must the affairs of State hang upon an apron-string? Look to your dishes, and see that your rooms be well swept, and never think to teach Tomaso what he hath to do.
Most excellent Sir, there's several poor Citizens without, who beg admittance, and pray that you would do them justice.
Let them have admittance: O, I do love that work alife; I am never well but when I am doing justice; they shall have justice to a hairs breadth.
Most excellent, and thrice worthy Tomaso, we are come to complain of the great injury we suffer by the most unconscionable Bakers; who contrary to all right and honesty, have presumed to bake such loaves as these, as little as when the Excise was on foot; and want one quarter of their weight, according to the al∣lowance.
Do you know the Bakers names?
Yes, here they be.
Carry these men (you I say) unto their own Ovens mouths, and let their Ovens be heated red hot, and put them in, and there let them be baked themselves;
 which will be a terror to all Bakers, how they bake light bread▪
How long shall they remain there?
No longer, but until you fee them all over of a crust, and their eyes look like parched plumbs upon a plumb cake, and then it's time to take them forth.
It shall be done.
I think I have done justice pretty well.
And if it please your Excellence, there are more Citizens without, desiring audience.
Some others, I warrant you, come for justice: bring them in.
How now, good fellows, what would you have with me?
We are come for justice to your Excellence.
Marry, and you shall have it, with all my heart, as freely, and with as good a will, as ever I came from School.
Sir, here's a list of certain Butchers, who refuse to sell meat otherwise then at the same rates they did, whilst the Excise was up.
Carry these men unto their own slaughter-houses, and there let them be knocked on the head, as they knock down their Oxen; and let their throats be cut, as they used their Calves.
I think I shall do such justice, ever it be long, that all the World shall admire me.
Sir, there are more Citizens without, with a Petition to your Excellence.
Let them come in: O, I am in my Kingdom now! O, how God-like it is, to rule and sway! I could be
 contented to forsake meat, drink and sleep, so that I might be doing of justice.
Genuino, read it.
Humbly shows,
THat whereas your said Orators were seated and pos∣sessed of good and substantial houses, and dwelling places, in and about the Mercato; and that by direction from your Highness, the said houses, to the number of 200 are ordered to be pulled down, to give way to the building of your Excellencie's Palace.
Now, forasmuch as your Excellencie's said Orators are utterly deprived of places of abode:
They humbly pray, that your Excellence will be pleased to take the premises into consideration, and either to give satisfaction to the said Inhabitants, for their said dwelling houses, or else to provide some other places of abode, whereby they may be disposed of otherwise.
So I will, and that presently: let them be all sent to the Galleys, and there let them make their abode: What? When the foot of Italus his leg was in the grave, I took it by the small, and reached it out again: When an Ocean of calamities had overwhelmed the Land, I made that Sea run back, and keep its channel: and do you now grudge me a place to build my house in? Ungrateful Monsters! you shall soon know, what punishments are belonging to so great a sin.
Your pardon, gracious Sir, we acknowledge our fault, and are heartily contented that your will should
 be fulfilled; now we understand our selves, and do hum∣bly beg your pardon.
Lie down flat upon your bellies then: so,
Now you may rise up again, and go.
Call you this the liberty of the Subject? and the property of what is ours?
I would we had our old Government and Gover∣nurse.
I am not only good at justice, but I can be as good at mercy, if I please.
Sir, Did you not perceive how they muttered forth their discontents at the present Government and Governors?
I did, my Genuino; but they shall find me of the nature of the Cock, that crows over the same dunghill, whose unnatural heat gave him so untimely and prepo∣sterous production: Their hands have reared me up, but I shall not be so easily dissolved, as are their bears of snow, which their hands have made unshipped, and melted to a shapeless lump, with the least shower of rain: Tomaso is more hard and lasting then brass or marble; not to be reduced to nothing, by the greatest showers of tears, that possibly can fall from the peoples eyes. These Citizens, if they abound with such bad humours, as I see they do, I'll purge them, even to the excoriation of their guts, and make them to commend my doings, as men use to praise the biting Mustard with tears in their eyes. I'll be their Oracle my self, and mean to confine all truths to my own mouth: I'll be their Colossus, all their Ships shall sail between my legs, and their money shall all run between my fingers: I am not what I am for nought.
Brave Tomaso, how like thy self thou speak, pro∣vender pricking hath made them cast their first Rider; and they will cast you too, if you do not hold them to hard meat.
 The corruption of estates is the generation of Soldiers; whilst you drive away their trade, you drive on your own: and what injury is it to them, to be first made beggars, and then to be paid with their own coin?
Excellently well advised, my good Genius! How excellently thou speak!
Sir, The Major and Aldermen are at the door to wait upon you to the Mercato.
It is well then, I shall have justice business e∣nough to last me all this day; and I'll lay it on, let whose will take it off. Daughter, anon the Prince will visit you, see that you are fit to entertain him in every re∣spect.
Truly my Son is strangely altered of late, he is not the same man he was wont to be.
Not suffered to speak to him, despised and jeered at every word; you hussy, can talk with him in private, and have whole hours discourse together, when his Mother and his Wife, I and his Daughter too, as good as you, are not thought worthy to speak to him.
He is my Father; and what I do, is but in or∣der to that obedience, which I owe to him; I cannot be justly accused of any intrusion upon his privacies, and for the common subject of his Discourse, it is as unpleasing unto me as to your self.
Hang you liar, I don't believe you.
It is a very likely thing; for when my Father calls her to his privy Chamber, O how she trips it along as she goes! How her colour rises! How she starts up when she is called! And makes such hast! I would not
 be guilty of such dissimulation for the World.
I would not be guilty of so much cruelty for ten Worlds.
What cruelty, you stinking baggage?
Not to believe a body, when one speaks truth: to chide a body for that, which one cannot help: to envy me, for another ambition: and, in a word, to make my duty to my Father, a displeasure to my Mother.
Vile Harlot! I'll make that face, the make bate of this divided family, as homely and deformed, as wounds and scars can make it. So, now let the Prince come and visit you, and tell me how he likes you.
Whore's my Daughter? Whore's Flora? I will show you a rare flower indeed.
It seems, there was a battle fought in the field, where this flower grew, and too much blood fell to her share.
Fury, this was thy doings.
Hands off: what and if it were?
Then thus I'd use her that did it.
O me! Father, what have you done? It had been better mine eyes had been stabbed out of my head, then left me to behold an act so barbarous.
O, Father; you have plaid a Butchers part:
She stabbed my face, you strike me to the heart.
Stay, gentle Virgin; let me hear how this business is, before you go; pray let me hear how it was, for it concerns me now; I came to be your Servant, and to elect you for my Mistress.
O Sir, I am altogether unworthy to be your Mi∣stress, or your Mistresses servant; it is enough, that I am your Martyr: wherefore I humbly beg you pardon, Sir;—for I
Have blood to stench, and also tears to dry.
A lovelier face I never saw: But, is she thus amiable, when she wants those compound ornaments of blood and tears?
Sir, you did but see the Sun behind a Cloud, or the Moon in an Eclipse, when you beheld my Daughter how: I tell thee Prince, thou shalt see her when her face is washed; and, if the scars have not too much disfigured her, you'll say, you saw a Queen, if beauty has domini∣on.
She talked of being my Martyr, as if she had received those wounds for my sake: how was that?
She did so; and it was thus: Flora is my Daugh∣la by a former Wife, that Blackamoor mine by this: This envious Woman, envying the happiness that your affections might throw upon that other Daughter, intone∣ded the ruin of her face, to make way for your addresses to this foul Dowdy: when, alack,
Her outset's not so swarthy, as her insid's black.
She's my Martyr then indeed; methought she looked very prettily, when the blood and tears ran races down her cheeks; and methought they did no more disfigure her, then streamers of red and white do misbecome the goodliest ship; and methought she carried a great deal of modesty and humility, both in her speech and countenance.
Sir, she is so full of humility, that I protest un∣to you, I could never get her to open an ear, or to leak into her the least thought of what is now. I could ne'er make her believe it: Father, saith she, forbear this
 vain discourse; it is just such another likely matter; as if you could make me believe, that you could turn the Horses of the Sun into your Cow pasture.
Extreme witty! I shall be in love with this girl, I see.
Whatsoever my Father and you
Do, let you and I agree; you go about
Your business; I'll go seek my Mistress out.
Most excellent Sir, we have intelligence, and it comes several ways, and from very good hands: but one especially amongst the rest, to whom we give most credit, is, a Letter to the Vice-Roy, which we intercepted, thin∣king it to have contained matters of other consequence; which assure us, that the French are upon the Seas with a mighty Fleet, and they say, their design is, for NA∣PLES: Sir, we thought fit to acquaint you with the business.
Most excellent Sir, have you provided the mo∣ney for the Army, I sent unto you for? I think fit to ac∣quaint you also with this business.
Sir, the money is most willingly ready, and most readily willing they were all to pay it.
Then most readily willing, and most willingly ready I am, that you should on to your other business.
Sir, I have spoken the business already, it is concerning the French.
What a pox do we care for the French? or the French with a pox? I would they were here, I long to be doing, now I have command and men enough.
I, but Sir, we are at odds among our selves, and it is to be feared—
I tell thee, Major, I'll be friends with the Devil, and salute his Dam, before the French shall have any thing to do here: and because they are so forward, we'll begin with them first: Go, and see that the heads of all
 the French men within NAPLES, be cut off (spy∣deli Go without any more ado, they shall have justice, I warrant you; justice hath not been executed a great while, and now it takes its course: O how pleasant a thing it is!
Sound Trumpet.
Hark Sir! a parley from the Castle.
Upon my life, it is about this business.
It comes very seasonably and welcome; let some know who it is that desires to treat with us.
If the King grants what we ask, then it is likely we shall do—what we please, so something may be done.
It is Card: Filomarino, who humbly desires to mediate between the King and the people.
Bring him in; I never spoke with a Cardinal yet, but I believe I shall be hard enough for him.
I am sent by the King, unto the most excellent Tomaso, and to the rest of the most faithful Neopolitan people, to acquaint them with what great dangers we are all in, by reason of a sudden and unexpected invasion by the French, which is like to find us in all the confusions and distractions, that are able to give them the greatest advantage, and us the most unavoidable ruin that can be∣fall a Nation, destinated to destruction: Wherefore, in regard we may, perchance, want this very time, which we bestow in words, to employ upon more necessary actions, he desires the most excellent Tomaso in the first place: secondly, all his loving people, that they will open their ears to peace, and accept of all that ever he can do, or grant, in pursuance thereof; and that every man that wants arms, or ammunition, will speedily repair unto
 the Magazine, and there furnish themselves with what is wanting: then the most excellent, and thrice valiant To∣maso, is desired, by his Majesty, and the whole Council, to admit of the conduct of these men against the enemy; an act of oblivion to pass, and all to be well.
Card: What is it that the King will do?
What is it that you would have him do?
Take off all Excise, all, all, all, all, &amp;c.
It shall be done: I'll undertake it.
And an oath never to set any up again.
Not only so, but I will tell you more: there shall be an everlasting Monument of Marble set up in the Mercato, containing the articles of Agreement between the most excellent Tomaso, on the one part; and the Vice-King, on the other.
Now you say something, Card: this is something to the purpose; but there is something behind, which must be done—or else, though all the French in France should fly in the air, like so many Crows into the Land; or come by water in shoal, like Herrings, yet will I not hear of peace, or believe a word you say.
Sir, these hands of mine shall bind them both together, but not a word of privileges.
Not one word, but mum: Let the Monument be speedily erected, and the Agreement sworn unto; for Card: we must have no delays, for they are dangerous.
We will go presently to the Vice-Roy, and have him confirm what is agreed upon: in the interim, your servant presents you with this, as a little pledge of great good will, and this.
Think you, that chains, or cloths of gold, can add? or the want of such poor toys, diminish from To∣maso's worth? He's very barren of just merit, that bore∣rows respect from the earths garbage: No, Card: I tell
 thee plainly, I think my self no more disparaged by these clothes, then the Sun thinks himself disgraced by Clouds.
The most excellent Tomaso speaks admirably: I must confess, the richest apparel sets him out but mean∣lie, who always goes so clothed with renown, and can put on new wonders every day: But Sir, I have known those, who would value pins, and rings of rushes, when they proceed from a heart that truly honours them: such is mine: such is my Present: such may your acceptance be, and it will be the greatest obligation wherewith I ever was obliged.
Well, I'll wear them for your sake, Card: you and I must be better acquainted; thou art an honest man, and speak truth, I love such an one: but hark you in your ear—
Yes, yes.
I, I, leave that to me.
Come, let us go then, wy this is excellent; no∣thing but ask and have: a brave World, if it will hold.
O tempora! O mores!
I Tell thee, sweetest, envy has done thee a cour∣tesie, to make thee look ten times lovelier then thou did before. I protest, as it is my chiefest delight to look upon thee, so it will be my chiefest hap∣pines to enjoy thee.
Sir, as it would be an over-high presumpti∣on in me, to believe all you say: so to say, I do
 not believe you were in civility, though but to a Gen∣tleman, but to my Prince it is rebellion: you say, you love me; nay, you protest you do, and swear it too; I, and that in an honourable way; it is a Princes word, a Princes protestation; it is a Prince that swears, if any thing can distill into my faith, the least dram of belief out of these professions of yours, it must be this; That it is as possible for me, Natures ruff cast, Envies ruin, Poverties child, to appear acceptable in your eyes, as it is possible for so good a Prince as you, to swear and vow otherwise then what your heart directs you.
Dearest Love, necessity requires your speedy assent; and for my love, which you seem so much to doubt of, rest you satisfied.
O Sir, that word, Necessity, is that which wounds my heart; for indeed it is necessity that sends you unto me; there being as little merit in me to invite you, as love has reason to bring you hither.
 O Sir, I beseech you, have pity upon me, and let me not be thrown into Paradise over the Wall, where my entrance shall be my ruin; or flung into your arms, or forced into your bed, for then I shall fall no welcomer then dirt, upon your cheeks; and show in your arms no otherwise then reeds and rushes, which a sinking man is glad for to embrace, to save his life. O, rather then so, most Princely Sir, I beg this favour;
 I will be contented, that it may be so contrived, that to satisfy my Father's high ambition, it may be given out, that we are married; and so ordered, that there may be no doubt made thereof, until all be settled: then shall the most excellent Prince choose him out a Wife, amongst the race of Kings, that may be worthy of him; and bless me with the happiness (only) of waiting upon her: for I had rather fall to my old contentment, of sitting alone by the Sea shore, mending my Fathers nets; where I could
 fancy the pebbles to be my Subjects, and the Waves my Courtiers, then to sit with you upon a Throne, where I am not as well seated by your liking, as guarded by your love.
How prettily she pleads against her self! and how forcibly she attracts honour, by flying it! Come, Flora, thou art mine.
Remember your self, and know who I am; I am a Fishers Daughter.
A Fishers Daughter is no good sound: Why did she trouble my ears with it? Let me see; why it is impossible that hue∣mane nature can be so much above it self, as is the nature of the Gods above humanity: and yet we know, that the Gods themselves have been suitors unto that which we call, Woman; and if I make choice of her, none can say, I have transformed my self into a Beast, a Bird, or into a thing that is inanimate, as have the Gods.
O, how my trembling heart expects the event of this sole conflict!
Thus it is Resolved upon the Question, if you will have it so, Necessity shall marry the Fishers Daugh∣la: but I'll have thee; thee, not by constraint, but by affection; not by compulsion, but by free choice; not to be the Jon make-peace of our Land, but as one who best deserves my love, and merits me.
Can there be a distinction then, between me, and the Fishers Daughter?
Yes, Flora, such a one as the Sun makes between a vapour and an exhalation; which being one and the same thing, whilst it cleaves unto the earth, is but a fog: but being exhaled and drawn up nearer towards the Sun, it appears as glorious as it self.
Great Prince, whose lasting fame is such, that flatteries can neither hurt, nor hyperboles reach, if I were good at either: with what faces will the honourable Women look, when they shall see such a one as I, as your Bride, delivered into holy hands, to be made yours?
With such like faces of wonder and amaze∣meant, as the household Gods did look, when mortals were exalted above their nature, and had their constellations in the highest Firmament, globed by the breaths of all the Gods, whilst they were tied to residence in taberna∣cles made with hands, and yet durst neither envy nor complain.
Sir, You speak such high language, that I am afraid you exercise Rhetoric, rather then Love.
I here engage my honour, as deeply, as the most unfeigned heart can direct a tongue how to oblige it, that I rather want language to express my love, then am either vain, or dissembling, in any thing of all which I profess.
Why then, Sir, I can answer you no more, but in this language— weeps —Speak, speak apace, my best Ore∣tours; speak out and tell him the news from whence you're come; hoe's good, and may, perchance, give credit—
Hold up, celestial showers, you'll drown a little World: the precious distillations are in value next to penitential tears, wherewith the gods oft drink themselves to such a height of kindness, that they forget that they are just—Weep upon my bosom, and make the soil fruitful in the increase of that, which thine own just me∣rit hath there sovvn with a full hand: What! doth she sink under the burden of her
 own joys, Flora, my Flora, cannot my voice recall thee sooner then waters, my affections are above their heate Flora, my dearest, dear Flora, where hast thou been? what dost thou mean to do?
Sir you may see my senses were all fled, when mine arms presumed to embrace that Sun it should adore, they are of too base mettle to make a chain for that neck.
Object that fond objection no more (I charge you) I consider thee now as thy fathers daughter, as thy Fathers Daughter now, I say; who at this time stands the absolutest of Monarchs, and commands all, me, Kings, and Vice-Kings, and the greatest Princes, nor doe I think otherwise then that the Fates prodigiously raised him up to this greatness to make thee my equal, I am not a Secretary of their State, nor privy Councellor to their wills, but whatsoever their Decrees are, I take it so, and so take thee.
Well then, I'll tell you what I will doe for you, I will bee faithful to you, I will never offend you, I will always love you, when I am with you, I will bee a servant ready to observe and put in execution all your desires, and when I am out of your sight, wheresoever I am, I will spend my time in studying how I may next please you when I come into your presence: when you ride from home, I will get up upon the wings of prayer, and will importune Heaven that no bad influence from their Stars may hurt you: I will so charm the earth with the often falling of my tears, that no noisome vapor shall arise to prejudice my love, and when you go into the wars I will have fervency enough in prayer (lawfully) to make you shotfree. When my Love shall charge his enemies the
 mouths of their Guns shall lose their voices, and their bullets when they come near my Lord, shall forget their message, Isle so prevail with—
Away, Away, thou little fool, thou: tic the pre∣riest little fond thing that ever I saw, what dost thou doe, nothing but weep, she weeps: Isle d•y up your rears for you: Come, he kisses her. Will that doe it? the earnest of my hearts union: the seal of all that ever I have said or promised; the assurance of what we are now going a∣bout, without more delays.
Let each man envy, what the gods shall praise.
How do you like your Mistress, Sirrah?
Well Sir.
Not very well I believe.
Yes very well.
Truly?
Truly I doe.
You are not taken with her?
So much taken with her, that Isle take her, and bless the fates which threw me headlong into so great happiness.
The boye's in love upon my life.
Sir, Isle tell you, I went unto her as if it had been some miserable Ward force▪d by his Tyrant Guardian to a piece of some deformity, and to be sacrificed to some soul beast, to preserve a fair estate; but when I came into her presence, I found the world could not parallel her for beauty, when I c•nvers'd with her; I saw she was match∣less for wit, behaviour, language, or any thing, that
 might complete or adorn the most accomplished of all her sex: nor shall all the riches in the world invite me for to seek another Mistress; rather then the meanness of her condition, should be thought a consideration why I should not have her, I would descend to her capacity and tu•n fisherman. Nor lies it in the power of art or force of argument to wean me from her.
Good Son, we are all glad she likes you so well, we were all afraid we should be fine to use both art and argument, to draw on your affections. But Indeed I have heard many commend her for a pretty girl.
Sir, Massenello is coming towards the Palace.
I'll go and bring him in.
By all means. Son, remember you ask y•ur father blessing when he comes in.
Sir, I shall ask him for a blessing, and the greatest blessing: that any man alive can give me.
Tomaso is welcome to us very oppor•unely, for my son was (even) upon your entrance in a high en∣comion of your daughter: truly in a word hoe's over head and ears in love with her, and I am glad to see it.
Vice Roy, you have reason for what you say: and I hope there is no love lost; my daughter loves him as well, and though I say it, she is a match for the best Prince in Europe.
I make no doubt of it.
But I have not heard your Son speak, yet, con∣corning her, let me hear how you like her from your own month.
Sir, I like her as a new come soul likes Elysium, and with the same affection that the most ambitious man likes sitting in a throne crowned with his own hearts desires.
Why then young man you're happy, when will you marry her?
When will the hunger-starv'd wretch eat meat? or the thirsty soul quench his flames? or the man that is a cold come near the fire; but as soon as ere he can.
Why then to morrow is the day, how says the Vice King.
With all my heart, the sooner, the better.
Come then we will to the Archive scovato, and there you both shall solemnly swear before the high Alter to perform all the Articles which are agreed upon between you both, in the behalf of the new made hap∣pier Neopolitans, and by this the Monument containing the articles agreed upon, is erected in the Mercato, and from the Cathedral, the Cavalcato in the greatest pomp, shall bring you both as pairs coupled in the same de∣sires of procuring your Countries good, and there before all the people, you shall consecrate the Monument with your presence; and let them all see how in your peaceable intentions you both meet in parallels like Apollo's twins, and from thence unto the performance of those nuptial rates which shall make the peace between you ever∣lasting.
The Card. is a good man, he speaks well, but when shall this be done, Card.
Come one thing first, another at the heels,
When ell's concluded action runs on wheels.
1. Ho Monsieur, have we taken you, off with his head.
O pardon a moi ie vous some pric.
2. Monsieur don't be afraid, we won't hurt your locks, we'll only cut off your head.
Vat have I done to you Gentlemen, mort dien?
3 Take heed of his Mistress favours there.
More sacks to the Mill, here's a couple of Mounsiers more, they are cutting off, I know not how ma∣ny Mons. heads every where.
Swounds, I am an English-man, English man, English man, Engleterra, Engleterra.
2. He cries Engleterra, Engleterra, and the Rogue speaks French.
3. You don't know, it may be English for ought you know.
1. A pox confound him, he's a French-man, you may know him by his points hanging at the wrong end of his breeches.
2. Away with him then, off with it, off with it, cut off his head, let it be cut off, though there were no more heads in England.
Damn me, and ram me, and sink me, I am an English-man; what a devil doe you mean to dee with me, I am an English man, I tell you, what won't you
 believe a body when a body tells you the right: Sounds I am an English-man; hell confound you all for a com∣pany of Arse-wormes, Turky-drivers, and Goat mongers; what a devil would you have? won't you believe a body with a pox?
3. Pish, pish, you may see he is a French-man by his locks and favours, and by his garnished cotpeece.
Away with him, away him, cut off his head.
What a pox are you, are all stark mad? is there never a wise man amongst you, that understands English.
A plague confound you all, a devils dogs couples, hags and furies light upon you, for a company of hog dogs, and cow-dogs, and vinegar-bottles.
If he will not be ordered, hold up his head, and cut his throat.
Hold Gentlemen, hold I pray you, he is an Eng∣lish-man, we know him.
3. You came in a very good time, or else you had sound your Country-man shorter by the head.
Shorter by the head ke they? hearlikins; I was never in such a fear in all my life: a pox on them for a company of block-heads, they could not understand sense, nor hear reason; a company of cuckoldly curs, take my head off: It is more then they could do, or else it had not been on now.
You are well enough served, you must be in the French-fashion forsooth, with your all a mode de France, with your locks, favours, and •ibbans.
Got by it: nay what had I like to have lost by it? for I am sure I had like to have lost my head by it which is more then ever I should have got by them as long as I had lived; but if they ever find me with your all a mode, de France, as you call it, I'll give them leave, not only to cut off my head, but to make a devil of me when they have done, pray change cloaks, and hats with me.
Doe you hear friend; what's the price of your Cods-head?
You see what it is, it is a French mans head.
I pray let me have it, I will give thee money for it.
What money will you give me?
What money will you ask?
A French Crown.
What shall I crown him now his head's off, he will be little the better for that.
You shall have it for half a Crown.
What shall I give thee for that sword?
Yours.
Thou shalt, for this is an all a mode de France too, I'll endure um no more.
Fee foe fume, ho what are you French men?
1. French, Mercy, Mercy, Mercy, Mercy: Making pitti∣full faces.
Eng. Rise up Sir Christopher Boon-grace.
2 French, A Sir, you be de good Englishman, me can spreake little English, me have been one, two, three times in London, spare you me I pre.
English, Come thou shalt see London the fourth time You must not bee so fearful, had I been so tame as you, whereas now I am a cutter off of heads, I might have cari∣ed mine own head thus.
Who have you there?
They are English Gentleman of my acquaintance.
BEhold the hierogliphiks of our peace and happi∣nes, the landskipp of a joyful Country, the Map of a world of good that is derived unto us by this days hap∣pines, a monument which gives the best characters of the most wise King, and the most invincible Tomaso, here is the original, peruse it and see if they agree not.
They agree to a word.
Tic well, but is it not pity that the wind should blow upon it? or that the rain should fall upon so fair a piece? or that the Sun should fade any of its colours? or that bold and forward hands should sully any of its pre∣cious stones? or that time it self, should eat, this, with the rest of things?
Most excellent Sir, I have given directions for a safeguard of Iron, whose bars shall be so high and sharpe, that not any shall be able to behold it, otherwise then at their due distance.
But Card: have you made any provision against Wind and Weather? that time it self may never fill her paunch with such bits, as are too great dainties for such a common feeder.
What the most excellent Tomaso shall think fur∣there fit to the preservation of that which preserves so great fame, wee shall bee glad admirers of, but for my own particular, I have given no further directions concern∣ing it.
Then I shall, whore's Sig. Burlameo.
It was nobly resolved on.
Burlameo I will have thee post to Egypt (ho doest thou stare upon me?) and there take pattern of the big∣gest Piramis that's there, and make me a shelter over this monument fifty cubits higher than the highest of all Egypt Pyramids, and that shall be a Penthouse to keep it from the rain, so that that greedigut Time shall find it the hardest bone to pick, that to feed upon it, it shall loosen the old teeth of aged time, that they shall drop out faster than these stones shall fall, and at last find it meat of so hard dige∣stion that time it self shall take so great a surfeit that it shall cease to be.
And dying yield unto eternity.
Ah Massenello, ah Massenello, ah Massenello.
This is enough to make him stark mad, lets foal∣low h•s humour.
S• I hear you, and having taken measure of your mind, Il• f•• i• to a hair,
When the d•vill's blind, your resolutions are like your self, great and glorious.
This age is happy that hath produced a man fit for so high and mighty undertakings.
Now nothing's left undone, but that which must be done, the marriage.
That shall be don, to morrow is the day.
That Hymeneus asks us leave to play.
Is the Apothecary coming? prithee go and fetch him to me, and stay you without.
I'll fetch him presently Madam,
My Mothers death I will revenge on her who was the cause of it, b•sides ten thousand hazards I will run, before Isle suffer her to prince it over me, that face which age could neither blemish nor years decay shall look as pale as death can make it. I'd rather dye my self then she should live to be so much above me, and thought worthy of so high estate whilst I neglected, stand like a forlorn hope perishing for want of seconds, and why? because I am black and shoe's fair, marry muff: I think my penny as good as her's.
Pepper is bleak and hath a good smack,
And every man will it buy:
When Snow it is white, and lies in the dike
And every man let's it lye.
Honest Apothecary I sent for thee to doe me a pleasure, I am so troubled with Rats in my chamber that I cannot be quiet for them, I pray thee teach me a way how I may de∣stroy them.
Madam I will fetch you some Rats-baine emma∣diately.
No, no, That's but a scurvy weak poison, they'll take it and live so long after it, that they'll creep hehind the Wainscot and get into holes, and there lye and stink, able to poison any living soul, I would have a quick dispatch∣ing poison that shall work presently upon them that they shall not stir from the place.
Mad: I warrant you, Isle fetch you such a poison as shall do the feat.
Why well said honest fellow: here's for thy pains.
I thank you Madam, I never was so rewarded for killing of Rats, I pray God she puts it to no worse use, but why should I suspect any thing, she pays me liberally.
My Lord, though I am not worthy to indent with you, or engage you to the least promise, yet I may be in ca∣pacity of begging a favour at your hands:
What is it? and command what lies within my power.
Here is my only sister, please you to take notice of her, and let her bee within your thoughts to make her happy.
As happy shall she bee as industry it self can find out ways to make her so-
I thank you Sir: I pray Sister keep your hap∣pines
 to your self, I doe not desire to be made happy by you.
She flings out of the room, and takes the Pot. with her, re∣mains in occulto.
What an unmannerly sister is this of thine.
Sir, It may be she cannot brook this happiness, wherewith you're pleased to crown me, and the more I seek to please her, the worse she is.
She's angry that she's so black, and thou so fair.
Not so my Lord, but it may be she is angry that a Prince of so great judgement should be so much decay∣ved in his choice, as is able to verify the proverb how that love is blind.
That love is blind indeed that doth not see
Causes sufficient for loving thee.
Love is not blind because he hath no eyes,
But cause he's guided by loves sympath•es.
Love sees, and seeing loves but yet in part;
But he loves thoroughly that doth love by heart.
But I'll tell thee my dearest dear, thy sister is mad that I am not a Suitor unto her, and I had as live be a Suitor unto the shades of night, and embrace a moon-calfe as to be l•nckt to such deformity.
Not so an't please your highness, shades oft∣tinies are sought for, when the brightest Sun-beames are eschewed; and though a black one please not you, she may be pleasing in another eye.
Come, come, I know and see her conditions to be as foul as is her visage, which is the index of her mind; it is thy goodness to say otherwise.
Well Sir, I that am so happy in your affections, have the less reason to be troubled at your dis-affection to any else but indeed I must entreat you to love my sister, though.
Well then, to morrow when she is my sister, I'll begin to love her, because she is my sister, though there be as much difference between thee and her, as be∣tween night and day.
Now your highness is pleased to speak of nights and days, when I think how that there is no day to come, only one night to pass, before you make me believe, I shall be your wife; my joys begin to be orewhelm'd with fears, and sadness takes possession of my heart, and outs those wonted lively apprehensions of the happiness I heretofore conceived of being yours: surely my heart hath only room for you to cast anchor there, and so possess me of some hope, but not to bring the Sovereign of a Sea of bliss, laden with the riches of your love into so poor a harbour.
Humility is the crown of all other virtues, and thou crownest humility, with such a becomingnesse, that she is true humility no where but in thee; and it deserves an exaltation, which it shall soon find.
O how I burn to be revenged: my malice (it is true)
Was first to one; now, in tha• one, to two.
Massenello steals in the night time unto his Monument to adore it, clad in his night You•e.
THus in the night of secrecy have I stolen time from sleep, that I might sacrifice with uncontrolled devotion, unto the Idea of my mind [He adores it.] Tic a fair piece. They were fools who thought to make Babels Tower reach heaven by building of it high. Approaches made to heaven, doe
 not consist in degrees of height, nor are steps, and rounds of stairs, and ladders ways to climb up thither, heaven is every where where men, God-like behave themselves.
Fools were all the Wisemen seven;
This is it that reaches heaven.
Come we'll be thought men no more; I begin to be im∣mortal the symptoms of mortality begin to leave me, sleep: that dull and senseless block-head, begins to know his distance; and to think himself no fit com∣pinion for us, hunger and thirst, begin to stand aloof, and not to rush so boldly into our presence as they were wont. I will shake off them too, and then mortality good night.
Alexander was an Ass, he would be deified, but never deserved it: he went with an Army of drunken Gracious, and so stumbled upon a victory; but did he overcome a warlike Nation with a company of boys and canes? did he frighten a company of daring Spaniards into their re∣treat, and ruin with the ruffling of a company of blew aprons? he that will become a Deity, must not rest himself contented with the attributes of High and Mighty, but he must be wonderful: And now I think on •, I will go and bethink my self (how I may teach the people how to fly, that things called walls, and towers, flanckers, and counter-scarfes, palisades, and stockadoes, fitter to keep hogs and dogs from entrance, then men endued with so rare a thing as is a soul, surely this invention was lest for me to bring into the world; I'll make them as good keep out the wind, the light, the common ayre, as keep out me; and so I'll conquer all the world, and not like fool Alexander, lye down and cry, because there be no more worlds to conquer. I'll go and be merry with the gods, drink their wine, sing cat∣ches with the angels, hunt the Devil, run races with the horses of the Sun, hob-naile my shoos with a couple of old Moons, and so drink a pot at every one of the ce∣lestiall
 signs. It is decreed, nor shall thy fort, O Rome resist my vow.
DAughter, the Prince hath sent you word that he is coming to fetch you to Church, eat this be∣fore you go, because state nuptial ceremonies are very tedious.
Grandmother, I humbly thank you: but I am so strait laced that I cannot get any thing down.
Come, come, you shall; there's a fine trick in∣deed, you may chance wish you had.
I, and repent it too, I'll assure you.
I doe not like it: there is something in it, that hath not a good taste—O I begin to feel it work, Grandmother I'm poisoned.
How poison•d? nay child I'll assure you there's nothing in it but what is good; for I am sure I put all the ingredien•s in it my self: you shall see me eat of it.
Mother don't, you don't know what may be.
Don't: I'm sure there▪s nothing in it but good.
O my senses begin to fail me, and this poisonous drug begins to work upon my vitals.
Cursed caitiff, what hast thou done, poisoned thy Grandmother and thy sister.
I told you that you should not eat of it, and yet you would.
Why then thou confessed the murder.
I doe, but not of you, you might have chose, now let us see in what fine pomp she'll go unto her wed∣ding.
Here's the murderess lay hold on her.
What's the matter?
Poisoned, and I too by that infernal hag.
Furies light upon her, O my dear Flora, run, and without there is a Padua Doctor, bid him come hi∣there quickly, quickly, quickly. O my dear Flora, she breaths, she's alive, she's warm. O help, help, help, for the Lords sake.
Now Doctor show your skill, and be renowned for ever∣more.
Sir, I have an antidote that if it hath not too much wrought upon the vitals, it will recover her; how∣ever, it will fetch her to her senses again for a while.
So it will dissolve of it self, hold her up.
She begins to look up already.
Dost thou know me? O I will punish that black devil with a hundred tortures.
No my dear Lord, let not my sister be put unto any tortures for my sake; for I forgive her with all my heart, and thank God that he hath given me so much sense be∣fore I dye, as to make it my last request to you, that you would do so too. I was once entering into the finest place that ever was seen; such fine flowers, such rare music, such glorious creatures! and the door was open
 for me, and all, and my thought some body pulled me back and told me that one would speak withme? was it you.
Dear heart it was I, would you not willingly if it lay in your power, forbear that place a while for my sake?
Though you are the finest man in the world, yet you are not so fine as any there, but I pray don't you doe any thing to my Sister, don't disgrace her.
She hath poisoned her Grandmother too, here she lies.
I am sorry for it, why would you use so much di∣ligence to recall me, and extend no charity to her.
Sir, it doth her hurt to talk so much, a little sleep will doe her good, if any thing, and gentle music would be requisite if it may be had;
Yes, call for the music that was appointed for our nuptial feast, and let them change their note, to sad Elegies. Carry that Cerberus bitch out of my sight, and let her be cut into a thousand pieces, and cast to dogs.
I stand your fury, swell until thou burst,
I am beforehand with you, do your worst.
O Ye Gentle powers above,
What are you your selves but love?
Pity lovers in distress,
Help us, help us more or less;
And we will sing you, your due praise;
If not years, yet give us days.
If you will not grant these things,
Doe but give my spirit wings.
And see how glad my soul within
Will be to leap out of her skin
 In life or death I care not whither;
So we two may be together.
If I ha'nt deserved such grace,
Give me leave to buy a place,
To be where she'll be by your doom,
I'll give a Kingdom for a room.
Crown and Sceptre, Throne and Ball
Let me have her, and take all.
She awakes, the music cease.
O Sir I must bid you farewell,
Stay a little my dearest Flora, I will marry thee in spite of death, that when I meet thee in another world I may claim thee as one that was sometimes mine. Priest do your office: stay a while, go fetch the murderess, that I may doe it in spite of envy.
Sir she is dead.
Bring her in dead.
Sir She is cut in pieces.
Bring in the pieces.
Sir they were thrown to the dogs, and the dogs have eaten them.
Let me have the dogs brought in, for by all thats sacred.—Flora makes signs to speak with him.
Sir she would speak with you, she feels her self departing.
What would my dearest have with me.
O Sir, I feel my self now going to the place from whence you called me back, doe so no more for cha∣rity sake, I gladly would have lived yours I must confess, but I am happier in this, that it thus lies in my power to express a fitter tribute of my love to you, rather thus to die your Martyr, then to live your wife, like Icarus I fly'd,
And soard too high, fell down and died.
Where are these fools that will, and won't bee married: why don't ye come away, they all stay for you?
O Sir, your devil daughter hath forbid the Banes.
What's here to doe, my mother and my daughter dead? who durst do this? that death himself (had I for∣bid him) durst not do it.
Your own daughter, poisoned your own mother, and her own Sister.
Where is she, she shall have justice.
That is done already.
How, justice done already, are you turned justicia∣rye? I thought there had been no more Justices but my self.
I thought according to the Articles of our agree∣meant, you were to become a private man, and to have no∣thing to do with justice business.
I tell thee thou Prince of Darkness, I am immor∣tall.
I will not dispute with you in that argument, on∣lie give me leave to take away this relic, that I may pay the tribute of mine eyes thereto, and perform the last kind office of a lover, in seeing her honourably interred.
Why did thou love her truly? would thou have been married to her?
Would you be wedded to your will.—
Nay, if thou love her but half so well, take her and much good do thee with her.
My mother dead, my wife dead, my daughter dead, al dead? why now I stand by my self like the popular star, fixed in his seat, and all the heavens of great and little ones do move about me. Me thinks that presumptuous boy began to talk of articles, doe they think that Isle be confined to articles, the sun may be confined within its tropickes, the
 Sea may be confined within its bounds, the earth may be confined in a circle: but Tomaso, cannot, will not bee confined: Isle therefore go, and presently confound, that presumptuous monument that dares confine Tomaso with∣in any terms, had it root fixed in the very center, I would pluck it up: or did the artic and antarctic poles, strike through it as stays to hold it up, I'd cast it down, I'll have my words law, my will reason, my pleasures obser∣ved, and my commands obeyed, I do not like this hoc nihil indeclinabile, i'd have ut sunt Divorum, Mars, Baccus, Apollo, Virorum, O I love to be like one of these thundering gods, I'll tell you what, I'll begin a new world, and if men wo'nt follow me it is no matter, it is but to teach foxes how to speak, they have cunning and subtlety enough, Lyons have strength, and valour, horses courage, dogs di∣ligence, and faithfulness. It is but teaching these the use of reason, and we will bid defiance to all mankind: and what is this to one that is immortal: but first I must down with this confining monument. I go about it.
WEE are all resolved to honour that fair body parted from as fair a soul, with as great solemnity as if she were my own daughter, or my own sons wife.
O Sir, the honour of those rich jewels which were engaged within this breast that's now turned to earth; can∣not be let down, or an inventory taken of half the good• she had there laid up in store, were all men in the worl• registers, the world paper, and the Ocean ink, The pens would scrawle the paper, and the paper drink That Ink Ocean up: the work unfinished lye: And a thousand pities call for new supply.
We all contribute sorrow to your sufferings, and pray we may not suffer too much with you.
Go know the reason of this noise,  I pray that all be well, the fellow was mad e∣nough before, and it may be this will make him ten times worse.
I it is no matter, and if he be; if •he people be not all mad.
I have brought you a great many of disconten∣ted people, who seem to be as much displeased with the times as we; I think we shall be very good company together.
Friends speak your minds freely, we give you leave.
Then Sir know; this Tomaso is mad: stark mad: he runs up and down the streets, striking every man, that comes in his way; has thrown down the Articles, will stand to nothing, breeds confusion, and turns all topsy turvy.
This is the Idol which ye first set up, and then adored, now ye know the difference, betwixt a golden Sceptre, and an iron rod.
I but a pox confound him, he made us believe such strange stories, and we see n•thing performed, where∣fore we are come unto you in the behalf of the rest of our fellow Citizens to make our grievance known, and to crave your assistance for our redress.
Alas how can I help you!
Nay Sir, we will help you: and our selves too, and you'll but give us leave.
My Masters, it was your own fault that brought you to this, and it must be your own virtue to bring y•u
 out of it again; he is of your own making, and now you would fine be rid of him if you knew how.
Yes we know how to be rid of him, and you'll give us leave.
How.
We'll serve him as he served us.
No, as he served us.
Ha, Ha, He.
About it then if you have the hearts.
I tell you Sir he is as dead already to my think∣ing as a door nail.
In the interim by all means let the Secretary be sent for, as about some earnest business, lest he prevent the plot, and when 'ti done, that we may be sure of him.
My Lord, I pray will you take the pains.
This is that which I was speaking unto you of, we must lay hold upon the present disgust of the people, and make it serve our turns, these joined together with the Morcato men, will make a good lusty party.
Here is the Secretary, I met him coming to your Highness.
What is your pleasure Mr. Secretary?
Sir I am sent unto you in the behalf of the people, who hear how that there is a great resort of Ci∣tizens unto the Castle, and those m•n of no good report.
And what then? what of that? what would you have?
They would know their business, and would not have you thus to countenance them; and further, they would have you leave the Castle, and remain with them for their security.
What people is that which you are come from? they were people that were here, and of more loyalty and understanding then the people that have sent you hither. Your Master's mad already, and you are little better.
Well Card. ere it be long you shall think your self the maddest of the three.
This villain must not go alive out of the Castle, if he doe, he will spoil the plot and us.
Sir, I desire your speedy answer.
Our answer is your dismission; you may be gone.
Is that all?
Thou saucy piece of insolence, dare thou con∣test with Majesty, be gone.
I go—but—remember this
Let the fool go, he will be met with, I warrant you.
Doe ye knew the man?
Yes, here he comes.
That's he.
Open the gate there, let down the bridge.
What are you? I will not open the gate, I have no order for it.
Well you shall rue it ere it be long.
Doe you threaten the Kings guard? take that:
O I am killed.
It makes no matter, you should have a better tongue in your head then.
It was not my tongue that made me thus depart,
But it was this vile, and base, and treacherous heart.
WOnders! wonders! without all bounds and measures. Death and Cupped quartered together last night in the same room: Venus called up her boy betimes, time called death, present employment was for both: the more haste, the worse speed: death groping for his quiver in the morning, laid his hand upon Cupids, and h•s eyes being out of his head, takes the boys quiver for his own: Cupped as blind as he, took the deadly quiver in his hand, and dressing himself in the morn∣ing, in ordering his wings, disorders some of his feathers in bruising them against deaths head, Venus having in∣telligence that her son had got such a chamber-fellow, to prevent mistakings brings in the light of nature; Cu∣bid whose feathers were not right, reaches and stretches out his wings, flutters, and claps them too and again, and blows out the candle: go then as you are, said Venus to Cu•id, Time said the like to Death; both never rested from journying till they came to my very door, being come there, they both strove for priority; Death said, he scorned to give place to Cupped, because he was but a boy; and the boy answered him as prettily again, that he scorned to be beholding to him, and so flew in at the window: By this unfortunate mistake, death who intended to strike me, slew my daughter; and Cupped that would have played his part with Flora, over-acts his part with me: Here I have it, here I burn. I cannot say I swim in love, but I am over head and ears: But where shall I entertain my Mistress? I will have all this great City contrive▪d into one house, and the inha∣bitants shall leave being Citizens, and become officers;
 its no matter for their liberties, so they be my servants, for that shall be their greatest freedom. Isle have my house well furnished with Taxes and Rates, and hung about with Sequestrations: For I must tell you, Sirs, I am be∣come immortal, and will make ye all Kings; but ye must be ruled by me, for ye shall see me fly in the ayre, walk upon the water, run through the fire, hang up the terrestrial globe, upon one of the Celestial poles, and it shall so hang by the secret invention, that all Sum∣mer long it shall swing towards the North, in Winter towards the Southern clime: so that both Summers heat, and Winters cold shall be no more, but a sweet temper all the year: nothing but Spring and Atom, pleasure and profit, shall ye have. This is the golden age the Poets prophesied of. I tell you what, they never sprinkled holy water over Vesuvias head; for if they had, it would have quenched its flames. To morrow I am to be married to Don Olympia. I bid you to my wedding. The triple Crowne's mine own already; and me-thinks I hear the keys jingling in my pocket.—
1. Peo. He talks extravagantly.
2. Peo. Hoe's wild me-thinks.
3. Peo. Stark mad.
Come down.
Come down I say.
Come down, why so I will come down; Time is to lose his fore-top, and Cupped is to be whipped; what would you have?
Your head:
Take it.
A Solemn funeral of Mass. in warlike manner passes over the Stage, Mass. open faced after the manner of the Italians lies carri▪d upon a Beer, he makes crosses, blessing the people with a counterf•it right hand, that is directed by a Fryer who stands under the Beer; the people cry out wonderful, wonderful, he blesses us, he was a Saint, and dyed our Martyr; this was but a trick of the royal party, who shall know that there are a hundred Massenelloes more in Naples.
HEre they are, here they be, let's fall upon them, while we may, we have lost too many such op∣portunities; make ready my Masters.
Gentlemen, what doe you mean?
We mean to let you know, what tic to murder
whose self alone was worth you all; it was but their hands that acted what your heads contrived, for which you shall soon suffer.
Let but these your executioners go with me to the grave, that I may but lay, my dearest Saint to rest in peace, and then do what you please; and for mine own part, if I ask you life, let me not live; for as her death did give my sorrows life, so my death will ease my pain, and end my sorrow.
He blesses us again: O holy Saint!
This was a Saint, not called a Saint, but as you see confirmed by wonder, and the hand of miracle.
By the hand of an impostor. If you will be undeceived, you may look under the Beer, and you shall find a Juggler playing the Hocus Pocus with you.
If neither the laws of God, nor the laws of na∣ture, or the Land, nor the rule of reason, yet let experience bear some sway, let palpable demonstrations work upon you, what do you doe with eyes and ears, if you will not believe their intelligence? do you not see your selves cous∣ended? Do you not see your selves puppet plaid into a new war? O return therefore to your old obedience, &amp; your hearts cannot desire more than your Prince will give you, what is past shall be forgotten, and forgiven, it is the false Cler∣go (my dear Citizens) who have contributed the fuel, laid it together, set live coals under it, and then have been the bellows to all those combustions, as if all mischiefs had been but so many exaltations of their brains, set on fire by the continual motions and agitations of their tongues, witness this incendiary, O return, return! unto your Prince, whose arms were always open to re∣ceive you into his bosom, whenever you should make it, though but your last refuge.
Well then good people, since it is so with you, you and the children that are yet unborn shall have justcause to say this was a happy day, and ye shall soon find the differ∣ence between a suppositious and a natural parent: Al things shall be so forgot as if they had not been, And perchance
We will laugh our follies out of countenance.
Vita il Re di Spain, vita, vita, vita.
Trumpets sound, Heralds proclaim.
To all persons of what degrees and qualities soever, is proclaimed a general pardon by the most—
Ha, whose that, that talks of a general pardon? the word revives me, and hath brought me my soul again, and hath fastened once more unto this clog.
Your pardon, and Isle speak the Epilogue.
LEt Kings beware how they provoke
Their Subjects with too hard a Yoke,
For when ell's done, it will not doe,
You see they break the Yoke in two:
Let Subjects no rebellion move
On such pretences least it prove,
As sad a thing, (which God forbid)
And fatal as to us it did.
Much blood spilt, great battles won,
Our treasure spent, and nothing done.
Least fools the wise ones do deride,
Gentles foot it, beggars ride,
Lazy Lubbers get the riches,
Women preach and wear the britches,
Lest vengeance fall as did on me
Undone; and my posterity,
Helped and succoured from all parts
Supported by the peoples hearts.
 Riches, honours made me glad:
Pride and glory made me mad,
Madness made me do such things
The people wished they had their Kings
The King assures them acts of grace,
Here they leave me in the place.
And like Action ('t may be se'd)
By my own dogs I'm worried.
Fond men be ruled, play not with Kings,
With Lyons claws, nor Serpents stings.
For Rebellion, and treason;
Rots your name, and outs your reason,
Could all the traitors that are dead,
But rise—they'd say—as I have sed.

It is strange Fidelius that they should Recover!
It was said their wounds were Morral▪
The Heavens are surely angry,
And lock their Azure Portals against our prayers,
Menacing the worse of miseries;
They would not else induce their powerful influences
To rescue Traitors from their punishments.
Oh Fidelius, when I but think what they have done by Butch∣ring Sacred Majesty—
I am astonished!
What 'ist these fear to do?
They'd Martyr JOVE, could they come at him too:
But yet Isle not despair, but by my Constancy
And Faith vanquish all miseries:
Our griefs be folly; our Tears cannot suffice,
Unless our hearts make Charles a sacrifice.
Content thy self Constantius; though Traitors flourish,
and such dunghill weeds sprout up through fatness of the soil.
It is but a time, and a time present too,
Then they'll be weeded out:
They can't demur, adjourn, or say to morrow;
When their Accountant calls, they must obey,
Though now they do o'er Truth and Justice sway.
The people say they were recovered by a miracle, wrought by one Peters an Excorcist, and now admire, adore, and think them Gods, more then they did before; And say it was Justice made great Charles to bleed.
Blind ignorant wretches, that can't perceive Gods from Devils; Impostors from Potentates; it's but in vain to inform them, till their own folly make them sensible; But does Crom∣well mean to steer his Course for Ireland?
For Hell he does.
I, that has been his Journey these seven years;
He will come to his journeys end in time,
But to Ireland I doubt he will not.
He tells the People that he will go, but that's in the My∣stery; he intends nothing less in the History: It is to get arrears, what men and money he can, and then Fairfax will soon un∣derstand whether he intends.
I hope his first days march will be to guard him to Tow∣er-hill, according to his desers, to make that his Head-quarters; and after retreat to Westminster and be Crowned, &amp; then he may make Deputies, and not expose himself to hazards upon so de∣sparate a Design, as Ireland is like to prove: Oh you know not the subtlety of that Jesuitical-head-piece! A little time will make known his intents: whilst then we will observe the cause• of their vile Actions, and discourse the Effects to our selves; yet let us be as secret as we can; these Serpents will sting us else.
We'll be as wise as Serpents, Serpents to prevent,
To Loyal-Doves, we'll prove as Inocent.
Wee're now at Amity, and made both one▪ I hope there will remain no Jealousies or Fears each of other?
I have not any the least Jealousy or Fear of thee my deer Lieutenant; but hug thee as my second Self: Oh that I could by this embrace beget a wit like thine; the State wants Policy as well as Money; and mine's but little, thine a full Magazine to arm a Kingdom, and muster all Designs, Plots and Stratagems of State with safety and ease to keep, what we have waded through blood and danger to obtain.
My Lord, I am your Servant, and the States; and must, and will endeavour to keep for them what I have got: But still my Lord, the People are too rich and powerful, they must have more Taxes and more Assessments to keep them under; and when they are poor and needy, they'll be the more our vassals, and subject to our power: Have not the peremptory slaves dis∣armed Capt. Thelwels troop at Drayton in Shropshire, taken both their Horse and Arms, &amp; stripped them to their skins? Have they not at Chester done the like? and since in Worcestershire? Come, come, they will Robel unless we make them poor; let's Tax them thoroughly; worse language then they do, they cannot give us; therefore lets about it; you to the Parliament and I to the Council of State presently.
Money's the life of War, and must be had,
Although we make the silly Hyndes run mad.
Is my husband gone to the Parliament-House Ruth?
Yes verily Mistress; he is gone amongst the Members, the holy-members, the fructifying-members, the increasing and mule∣tiplying-members. Indeed Madam, something was the matter my Master called for Beer so early this morning; Ha, ha, ha, I hope it will appear ere long: I promise you I thought something not∣withstanding when he fetched such a draught, 〈◊〉 pitt•y your Case Madam, but cold not cry; pardon me, I am your waiting-Maid, and can a little understand what belongs to the case of a Gentlewoman.
If thou had as much cause as I, thou might cry 〈◊〉 dye too: Isle tell thee Ruth, he lies by me all night like a log, though I warm him, and warm him again, yet notwithstanding I can get no life nor motion in him; And when my desires are fervent and ready for the on-set, he like a Coward faces-about, falls off, and basely retreates, and will observe no postures at all: Nay, if he would but Present, it is so hot upon the matter, that it would go near to give fire, and discharge it self, and do execution too: Let me woe him, and woe him, he will doe nothing, starts in his sleep, cries out Blood, blood, and says he is damned in his bed; and Verily, verily, I must say unto thee Ruth; that I think he is bewitched, for since he had the last wound with the fall on his Sword, he has been so cold, and as useless to me, as a King is to England.
Intrude la Mistress get another, the world is not so dull, if one won't another will; It is no matter for Fame, it is but a Bladder of wind, one prick of a Pin•• lets it ou•; if you have a mind to taste the sweets of Love, satisfy your desires to the full; I shall be as useful to put it forward as another.
She that confines her beams to one mans sight,
Is a dark Lantern to a glorious light.
Madam Isle fetch the Party you wot of.
Prithee do. I hate all bloudy-men, give me the man that arms with an embrace; can make, not kill a man: O how powerful is Love, that it can make an unjust Act seem ho∣nest, nay lawful too—
What makes my Love thus solitary and alone? Come my Life, my Happiness, lets taste some sweets shall make the gods to envious; There is no pleasure, but in thy embrace.
You men love to flatter us, and we like silly fools are pleased with all that comes from them we love.
I'll please thee if I can my Deer, the Paphian Goddess never was worthy of such love as thee; Lets in and taste,
And by our close in-twines,
We'll teach the wood-him, to embrace the Vines.
We must be secret though, because of the wicked, they are apt to scandal us, and bring us on their Stages; yet I
have done the best to have my husband put them down, yet all won't do.
Come my dear, I'll •••thee down, and act a part, shall ravish thee, and cheer thy grieved heart.
Such acts best please, whose s••nes relish of love,
Sound Music then, and ravish from above.
So, now we are in our Kingdom: What is it to enjoy the World, and miss the thing we love? Here is a Jewel for thee, it was the late Queens, wear it for my sake, and come to me to morrow, thou shalt have Gold what thou wilt have; thou shalt not want if the State has it: Spend freely, and when it is gone, thou shalt have more. My Noll shall fight with the Irish, thou shalt fight with me, clad in more softer Arms. Abi∣gail how sits this Gown?
It bears an exceeding Grace behind; Madam, you have rumpled the Pleats with your Day-Couch, will you have another?
Fetch me the Cown that cost 2000 pounds, if it likes me, I'll put it on; My dearest Morley shall see how it be∣comes me; and embrace me in it.
So sweet a body deserves the rareties of Europe, and all to little to dec• you Madam, I am doubly blessed to en∣joy so noble a Mistress as your self.
Lets in my dear, and sport a while,
And with sweet love, the tedious time beguile.
Yet I have managed State-Affaires with case and ••ill, and thrive and am grown Rich by my industrous practice:
Here's Letters from Scotland I fear will not be pleasing; 〈◊〉 I must deliver them; Yet I hope by this new troubling the waters I shall get most Fish; Isle in, and seek my Lord General pre∣sently.
Am I awake, or in a Dream? or do I walk in my Sleep? This is no vision sure: methoughts I saw two (whom I am loath to name) glued like a pair of Goats in a sportful dalli∣ance; I must wink at this, there's danger to disclose it, least that her husband should not credit me, and she should lay that to my Charge, was acted by the other; It may be her Lord Consents: I know not what to think! If these be Queent-street doings, Isle to Kings-street to the Lieutenant General to see what he will say to these Letters. Isle be silent, there's nothing to be got by this discovery; besides it is my own case at home daily.
He that will wind his borne in his own rounds
May chance to be devoured by his own hounds.
If this trade fails, then farewell all; Albertus was a mere Juggler to me; and Friar Bacon but an empty scull, or brazen Image, his Walls of Brass, were Mud to mine: Preaching is too radios for me; Isle leave that to Owen, and to Goodwin: Have I not done a Miracle to re-possesse these Bodies with Spirits, that were before mere Skeletons, and stinking Carcasses? (by their despairing rage) they are now as active as ever they were; and possessed with worser Spirits, if worser can be, to manage the grand Design; But before I proceed further in my Art, I must raise the Ghost of Dorrislaw, and ask his Counsel. Make a Circle and Cunjueres.
My hair stands upright! a flash of Lightning has gone through my body, and cut my thread of Life a too; I have no power to speak!
What's he that calls me from my place of horror, where all my music is dismal shrieks of damned Souls, yelling in beds of burning Brimstone; Couches of poisonous Toads and stinging Serpents? O M. Peters is it you? you shall along with me.
I pray thee gentle Ghost forbear, and tell me if the late King be in these lower Regions?
No, thou Viper, he reigns in Heaven; in Hell there are new torments providing answerable for that damned Crime without all presidents but Bradshaw. Cook, and Steel, and such as those have forged;
Knaves hired by Cromwell to corrupt the Laws:
Now all made food for Hells devouring jaws.
Next Iudas, Fax, and Ravilock, their lodgings are prepared: there lies Essen, Pym, Strand, Hamden, Rainthrough, and ten thousand more; there Fairfax, Cromwell, Ireton, Pride, will all like me, Rue their damned Regicide:
Their vengeance hastened, and come on a main,
Though the first be gone, the Second Charles shall Reign.
Let me go tell them this.
No, thou must not; Pluto won't give way,
His Fiends attend; and will not longer stay.
I'll enter here, and see if I can meet with such a sight I did before.
Hell and ••mnation 〈◊〉 what, •re we all turned Sodomites— O my head, how it ••es, Isle home presently; and If Roe be there, what shall I do? fight with him I dare not; •will but be the worse; for then my wife will take his part: since others being my betters wear the horn; Isle think it honour, never dream of scorn: but my neighbour will call me Withal, that's the worst;
No matter, I am ne'er the worse,
The Fox thrives best, when that the Geese do curse.
Since it is our fate; and now grows all the fashion▪
Isle rather honour, then disgrace the Nation.
Isle love the man▪ that makes my Wife his mate▪
And hug his Purse, till he doth horn my pate.
But does the news hold true concerning Ire••nd?
Too true, I fear; We must divert our Course some o∣there way; Ormond is 20000 strong; it is thought he is now 〈◊〉 Fortifying all the Ports, and then intends for England.
I would we had him here.
It is not a hundred thousand that we fear. Our Horse are lusty, and our Men be strong.
I, but our Money's weak; how shall we do for that the People won't disburse?
Can we not force it then? Necess••y must not observe a Law; make them but poor, and then we shall not want Soul∣diers nor Monies: Are we not the Keepers of their L•berties? why not their Money too?
We will disburse, give them as they deserve,
It they'll not sight; then let them h•ng and starve.
When we have all; we'll order them at will: If we suffer them peaceably to enjoy their Esters; we must not look to enjoy ours; No, I hold it best to kerb• them in, be s••e to keep them down,
Prosperity will always aim to get a Crown.
Besides, when we have all; we know what to trust too; and not before: then we can disburse at our pleasures; and rather then want; if there be urgent necessity, make use of our own Estates at last, but not before; it is our best policy to preserve all we can against a rainy day: Lands are but d••• Commodities, they will not off; besides we can't mans•••• them: Money it is must do the deed,
That's our best friend, should we but be in ••ed.
We'll have it then: Come le•• draw our Force• into the Countries first; and then we'll come upon the City with afresh supply;
Fairfax ••rall down; for he is grow• to hi•▪
Will they murmer still? Indite me for Murder! Who dares do it? have I not Forces to protect my self? this is Lil∣burn and his Faction; they'll never be quiet till they have my life; but perchance Isle have some more of theirs first.
Hang up two or three more, twill make the rest to fear.
It was by your Counsel I hanged up those I did: Did you not at War• persuade me to have Arnold shot, and L•ckier since; that won me hate of all my Soldiers, and the People too.
And that I hope will quickly end thy fate.
My Lord, Justice must be done; you know I, in all such cases,
cannot help ye; I am called hence and must away; the safety
of the State requires it: Farewell my Lord;
If that my Plot hit right:
My Policy shall Conquer all your Might.
My Lieutenant is too wise for me; well, if he does set the People on me for their Agreement I am lost; I fear it is his Policy to with-draw himself, that they may have the better op∣portunity to surprise me, and free himself, so they cut me off; that he may enjoy all: Something is in it; I am so troubled in my sleep;
My wife afflicts me too, which makes me weep.
What Game is there in this Park?
O Sir; here be Stags of State, Harts, Bucks, Does, Sorrells, Sores Teggs, Prickets, Fawns; and oboe∣mination of Fish and Foul.
Will you give me the Names of them all, because 〈◊〉 may know what to thank the Parliament for 〈◊〉 they have be∣stowed much of us, for this one Dinner; enough to make us many: Stags and Harts I have heard of in the City; and Bucks too; but Teggs, Brocks, Sores, and Prickets, I know not what they mean: pray are they Fish, or Fowl?
Neither Sir: they are Beasts, that come to it by de∣grees, as your Children newly born, first they come to be Fawns, and then in their youth, they come to be Prickets; in their prone∣tiship, to be Brockets; in their freedom, to Bucks of the first head; when Common Councel-men, of the second head, when Alder∣men, of the Game Royal; and then you may know them by their Brow-Antlers: And for the Hinds and Does they be the Femals, as it might be your wives, or your Sons wives.
It seems there is a Common-wealth in a Park; but do they engender too?
Yes Sir, in Rutting-time; how could they increase else? only they defile their members.
But do they do the Act like us?
Very like you Sir; but increase more.
Are there Cones too?
Yes Sir, more then you have in your City.
But does not some vermin annoy them?
Yes Sir, but we have another vermin called Ferrets and Tarryers, that like your Worships Clark Everett, can enter their grounds &amp; so ferrit their beries, that many times their skins pay for their offences; &amp; then our traps are just like your prisons.
Their skins may serve to fur us Gowns.
Sir, no Scarlet nor Plush is finer wear.
Hereafter, you must preserve them for us then.
Sir, they are my Fees; besides your Worships should not be clad in Foxes, or in Pole-catts skins, least you be termed vermin; the Lyons, or the Panthers, or the Ermyns skin is more rich and fitting for your wear.
I know no great degrees of skins; methinks the Asses hide's as serviceable as the Lyons skin, &amp; more fit for ornament.
There be Asses too Sir in the Park.
Then for Fowl and Fish, what store is there?
O••, they •esin••ite •here be Owl•, Wood cocks, Buzzards, Cuckoos, Rooks, Wiggins, and all •e•• Worship•••∣cen desire: Besides Parliament Pu•trick•, Halpyes, Night-Ra∣vans, S••eech-Owles, and whatever your Worships can name. And for Fish, here be Pikes, that like those you know where, eat up their own kind; and C••ps that die wallowing in the M•••de (like your Worships in your feather, beds;) besides the Carpes may serve for your servants, and the people; and great Tench, that you may ca•ch without books or pulls; besides Roach, Dace, Eels, Brooms, Perch, and abundance more.
Are there no Whales, Saturn o•s or Lobsteks there?
No Sir, they are in the Seas, where your Worships Ships sail.
I had thought they had come from hence.
Well Brethren, it behoves us to give thanks to the Council of S••• and the Parliament for all these benefits, and a 〈◊〉 n•• them the Sum; it is but 150000. l. a mere toy; if the Sea be but secured by their Navy, we shall fetch it up again in a year, and less.
Content, content, let them have it, let them have it; and our Letter of Thanks 〈◊〉 boor.
Since we have b••k, O•d Sport and Deer such store;
If they do ask, they shall have ten times more.
Yes, yes no doubt but they'll be as free to you, of that that is not their own. 〈…〉 aside. The •ight Ma•••, Pa•••, Cha•es and Forests, are liberally bestowed; the old proverb must be verified, Lightly come, lightly go, but they that steal a Deer off the Kings Ground, the Horns may hereafter chance to choke them; but they that steal Deer, Trees, Lands and all; the very stones will fly in their faces I hope: What it blessed litter of City-puppies have I to my Ma∣sters? O for a pack of good bloud-hounds to set on these Actaeons: Uds—foot, these be mere Gulls, Buffle-pates; there's not a man of them has so much wit, us will reach from his nose to his beard: foh— how they stink; I think some 〈◊〉 them have be-shitt themselves. Will your Worships please to see some sport 〈◊〉 the Game is ready, the Buck is Roar•d,
—〈◊〉—loo,—ha—loo•—〈◊〉—tat,—tat,—tat.
This is heavenly Music.
Wooed these Currs were choked, I cannot hear it for them.
Why, it is the Dogs that makes it.
I had thought it had been come from the Skies. The Buck is down already.
It is time we seek our Company, and give over the Chase.
This is no Chase Sir, it is a Park.
We are summoned in; let's haste away,
This idle sport has quite consumed the day.
Let's tell our selves, and see if we have all our Com∣pany.
Here's two missing!
I'll lay a Pot of Ale of that; have you told your self Sir?
I'll tell again.
There wants four now—O, Alderman Soams, and Al∣aldermen Chambers did not come; there was but 13 came, and now there is but 11; then as I take it, two are wanting.
But how shall we know which two?
It is my Lord Mayor, and Alderman Atkins are missing.
O Gentlemen, Gentlemen, your Mayor has hanged himself in a Tree, and if you go not quickly hoe's a dead man; and a∣another is fallen into a pit, and hath so bewrayed himself, it is wonderful! I think he has broke his neck, for he stir• not.
Brethren away, I fear there is some Treason.
Treason 〈◊〉 Traitors! Is not that Non-sence 〈◊〉 I have done my best to Lodge the Deer on that side the P••• where the most trees and the pitts were; but surely that is not
reason; and yet I know not neither, for 〈◊〉 everything 〈◊〉 made treason, though it be but Reason in I'll away to 〈…〉 it is good to prevent a mischief.
Farewell old Custard-eaters; I hold it reason.
Not to serve you, for fear I commit treason.
THe Devil stop your mouths; will nothing serve you but The Agreement of the People, The Agree∣meant of the People! Are not the Parliament the Peoples Represe•••eves? why, do not they A∣gre? I am willing to Agree to any thing; yet must their splee• light upon me? O Cromwell, Cromwell, for this I may thank thee; I am so heavy, sad and drowsy, I must take Rest.
WHo on the top of Fortunes Wheel.
Stands more glorious then the rest?
Others sorrows li••• feel,
Thinking all like them at blessed.
Guide the Chariot of the Sun,
And thence blind with too much light,
Such un-even Courses run,
That they turn the day to night.
These are they that cannot see,
Dazzled with the height of place,
How they may secured be
Of the peoples fickle grace.
But pretend their hearts so deep,
They are hopeless there to wade;
Where did they but measure keep,
Fortunes Children should not sad.
Greatness here may learn to stand
Propped with Virtue, so it shall
Fearless from rude peoples hand
Sleep on Down, or softer fall.
Fumes of Sway must pass away,
Rebels fall, that stand by Art;
Charles His Virtue still shall sway.
And all England take His part• 〈◊〉
What though Rebels fret and frown,
That durst aspire unto a Throne▪
Virtue is a Sacred Crown,
Subject unto none but O••.
A C•••d, a ga••d; Treason, treason; I am betray 〈…〉 O my distempered Fa••y▪ how strange guilt 〈…〉 with∣in, well, since it is so 〈◊〉 it is but a folly to despair; and to ••pent, would argue•• I were guilty; I have had strange dreams 〈◊〉 all it not well▪ Well come what will, •e bide the shock of all; And if I stand, I stand; it may I ••ll.
Where be the Murderers? seize on them; knock them down: knock them down; Traitors, Tyrants, bloud-suckers; away with them.
Who builds his Hopes upon a Comm•n Rou•, Thus must he f•ll, though for their Rights he fought.
Now my dear Fidelius; how likest thou the times now? do they not change apace? doe• not Divine Justice clearly demonstrate to the World their guilt, and dog them at the heals? do not the Phat••• ••mble now? Blood must be revenged; Murder and Patricide, although concealed long, at last betrays it self; nay often times proves his own executio∣ner; but this licensed and open wickedness, invites all hands to take Revenge.
The People threaten revenge on all; and do dis∣put their deaths before their ends: some report Bradshaw hath hanged himself, another drowned; a third is st•bb'd; when
as they speak but as they'd have it; or as it must be: Thus they oft times say, Hoe's a dead man, that's but condemned; and so are they by heavens Impartial Law; they're but re∣priev'd a while, the day will come.
They suffer must, a most assured doom;
That Subject make his Sovereigns heart to bleed,
Will find a Subject shall revenge the deed.
It is true Fidelius; but they never think of that; Re∣billion so bewitches them, they know not what they do; but with stupidity and ignorances; resolve to finish what they have begun, though to scale heaven, or to put out the Sun.
When did you see Rebellion prosper? But for black damned Regicide, (by Cook &amp; Rad••thus Se••l accounted lawful) it is a sin made Iud•• beholding to a 〈◊〉 to ease his Conscience, but these far worse then R•••agaces or Jewes, must expect Judgements worse,
The more their sins against light, the worse their Curse.
They say that Fairfax doth die to day; shall we go see him.
No, I love not to see the death of any man; nor have I envy at their persons, but their Crimes; I'd rather see them live honest men, then to die Traitors. This is Cromwels Policy, now he hath filled this Sp••ge to squeze him; till a∣another does so much for him, which will not be long; if Over∣ton speak true; that Bull's designed for the slaughter next; if he were but well baited first in 〈◊〉.
Dublin is for certain taken, londonderry can't held out; which makes me think he can do little good there if that he were Landed, which is a thing almost impossible.
Let's leave the success to him tha• prosecutes; and into 〈◊〉.
The Sun decines, and takes leave of the West.
Come b•i•••ion a way; I never thought he would come to better end, fine▪ he 〈◊〉 hi• word as New Mark•••
and likewise his Oath and Covenant with his King, and his dear Brethren the Scots.
you had best repent; your time's but short.
Your Pardon from His Holiness is firm;  You need not here repent.
This is a Jesuite, a Jesuite: Hang him, hang him.
Nay pray good people spa•e my Life, and give me have to speak; I shall tell you what will make you wonder.
Speak then; but be brief, pr••raction may cause a∣another Change.
And so it will; Let the Sheriff look in the N•pe of my Lord 〈◊〉 neck.
The Sheriff looks in the N•pe of his •eck, and finds a Charm, which he pulls away; and his Carcass falls and leaves a noisome stench.
What's the meaning of this, good Sir?
It is a Charm; the words are dubious, and cannot be made sense of; and this he brought from Holland; Cromwell has the same; it was to preserve their Carcasses while such a time expired; else they had been dead long time before; and often killed by others.
How come it then that Peters cured them?
Peters weary of Preaching Schism; and finding o∣theirs preferred before him, turns Necromancer, and deals in the black Art: Now their Charms was to preserve them from o∣theirs hurts, but not their own; they falling by their own swords, were by Peters, re-possessed with Devils, which gave motion to their bodies.
Is the Execution past?
More Witches, more witches; fall upon them, stone them.
My Husband murdered! Draw Mr Gorge.
I met with you there Sir;
Nay then thou villain have at thee.
And for thee Mrs •r••, (it is no time to s••lt) 〈…〉
Here is a sudden Tragedy indeed;
I doubt there's more ere long will bleed.
Hang them, stone them; Witches, Murderers, Th••∣ves, Impostures: Let's Petition our King home; we shall no∣ver be happy else.
Content, Content;
Come Royal CHARLES, and with a cloud of thunder
Disperse this bed of Snakes, and keep them under.
