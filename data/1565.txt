INterpone tuis interdum gaudia curis
Ut possis animo quemues suffer laborem
Doo any of you know what latin is this
Or ells wold you have, an expositor•m
To declare it in English, per sensum planiorem
It is b•st I speak English, or ells with in a while
I may percace mine own self, with my latin beguile.
The two verses, which I rehearsed before
I find wrote•n, in the book of Cato the wise
Among good precepts, of living a thousand more
Which to follow there, he doth all men auise
And they may be Englished, breflie in this wise
Among thy carful business, use sum time mirth &amp; joy
That no bodily work, thy wits break or no.
For the mind (saith he) in serious matters occupied
If it have not sum quiet mirth, and recreation
Interchangeable admixed, must nets be soon wearied
And (as who should say) tried, through continual opera¦cion
Of labour and business, without relaxacion
Therefore intermix honest mirth, in such wise
That your strēght may be refreshed, &amp; to labours suffis•
For as meat and drink, natural rest and sleep
For the cons•ruacion, and hell•h of the body
Must nets be had, so the mind and wits to keep
Pregnant, fresh industruis, quike and instead
Honest mirth, and pastime, is requisite and necessary
For, Quote caret alterna re queen du• abel non est
Nothing may endure (saith Ouyd) with out sum rest.
Example, proof her of in earth is well found
Manifest open and very• evident
For except the husbandman suffer his ground
Sum times to rest, it wol bear no fruit verament
Therefore they let the filed lye, every second year
To the end that after rest, it may the better corn bear.
Thus than (as I have said) it is a thing natural
And naturally belonging to all living creatures
And unto man especially, aboue others all
To have at times cōueniēt pastaūce, mirth, &amp; pleasurs
So they be joined with honesty, &amp; kept with in due measurs
And the same well allowed not only the said Cato
But also ye Pyilosophers, Plutarke, Socrates &amp; Plato
And Cicero Tullius, a man sapient and wise
wills the same, in that his first book
W•each he wrote, and e•tytulid, of an honest mans office
Who so is disposed thereupon to look
Where to deaf••e, and offirme, he boldly on him took
That to here Enterluds, is pastime• convenient
For all manner men, and a thing congruent.
He rekeneth that namely, as a very honest disport
And aboue al other things, commends ye old cōmedie
The hearing of which, may doo the mind c•mfort
For they be replenished with precepts of Philosophy
The contain much wisdom &amp; teach prudēt policy
and though they be al writē of mattiers of non īportaūce
Yet the show great wit, and much pretty conu•iaunce.
And in this manner of making, Plautus did •xcell
As records the same Tullius cōmending him bi name
Wherefore this maker deliteth passinglye well
Too follow his arguments, and draw out the same
For to make at seasuns cōu•niēt pastims mirth &amp; game
As now he hath dō this matter not worth an oyster shell
Except percace it shall furtune too make you laugh well
And for that purpose only this maker did it write
Taking the ground thereof out of Plautus first cōmedie
And the fi•st scentence of ye same for higher things endite
In no wise he wold, for yet the time is so ques•e
That he that speaks best, is lest thank worthy
Therefore, sith noting but trifles may be had
you shall here a thing yt only shall make you merry &amp; glad.
And such a trifling matter as when it shall be done
Ye may report and say ye have heard nothing at all
Therefore I tell you all, before it be begone
That no man look to hear of matters substantial
Nor mattiers of any gravity either great or small
For this make•r showed vs that such manner things
Doo never well besime little boys handelinges.
wherefore if ye will not sowrelie your broues bend
At such a fantastical conceit as this
But can be content to hear and see the end
I woll go show the Players what your pleasure is
Which to wait upon you I know bee ready or this
I woll goo send them hither in too your presence
Desiring that they may have quiet audience.
OUr lord of Heaven and sweet saint Ihone
Rest you merry my moist•rs euerychone
And I pray to Christ and sweet saint Steu•n
Send you all many a good even
And you to sir, and you, and you also
Good even to you an hundred times &amp; a thousand mo
Now by all these crosses of flesh bone and blot
I reckon my chance right marvelous good
Here now to find all this company
Which in my mind I wished for heartily
For I have laboured all day till I am weary
And now am disposed too pass the time, and be merry
And I think noon of you, but he would do the same
For who wol be sad, and needs not, is •o•le to blame
And as for me, of my mother I have bin tought
To bee merry when I may, and take no thought
Which lesson, I bare so well away
That I use to make merry oons a day
And now if all things happyn right
You shall see as mad a pastime this night
As you saw this seven years? and as propre a joy
As ever yon saw played of a toy
I am called Iake Juggler, of many an oon
And in faith I woll play a juggling cast a non
I woll cunger the moll, and god before
Or else leat me l•se my name for evermore
I have it devised, and compass•ed thou
And what ways, I woll tell and show to you
you all know well Moister Boungrace
The gentleman that dwells here in this place
And Ienkine Carreawaie, his page as cursed a lad
And as ungracious as ever man had
An unhappy wage, &amp; as foolish a knave with al
As any is now, within London wall
This Ienkine and I been fallen at great debate
For a mattier, that fell between vs a late
And hitherto of him I could never revenged be
For his moister maintained hī, &amp; loves not me
Alb it the very truth to tell
Another of thē both, knows me not very well
But against al other boys, the said gentle man
Maynteyneth him, all that he can
But I shall set little by my wit
If I do not Ienkine this night requite
Ere I sleep Ienkine shall bee mete
And I trust to cume partly out of his dete
And when we mete again, if this do not suff••e
I shall paye Ienkine the residue, in my best wise
It chaūced me right now in the other end of ye n•xt street
With Ienkine and his master, in the face to met
I abode there a while, playng for to see
At the Buklers, as will be commed m•e
It was not lunge time, but at the last
Bake cumithe my cos•no Careawaie, homward full fast
Pricking, Prancing, and springing in his short cote
And pleasantly singing, with a merry note
Whither a way so fast, tarry a while said oon
I cannot now said Ienkine, I must nides bee goon
My moister sups hereby, at a gentylmans place
And I must thither feache my dame, masters boūgrace
But yet er I go, I care not motche
At the bukelers to play, with thee oon fair toche
To it they went, and played so long
Till Ienkine thought he had wrong
By cokes prceious potstike, I will not home this night
Quote he, but as good a stripe oon thie head light
Within half an hour, or sum what less
Ienkine left playng, and went to fetch his maisteris
But by the way he met with a Freuteres wife
There Ienkine and she fell at such strife
For snatching of an Apple, that down he cast
Her basket, and gathered up the apples fast•
And put them in his sleue, thē came he his way
By an other lane, as fast as he may
till he came at a corner, by a shoops stall
Where boys were at Dice, faring at all
When Careawaie with that good company met
He fell to faring, withouten let
Forgetting his message, and so well did he fare
that when I came •ye, he began swear and stare
And full bit•rlye, began to curse
As oone that had lost, almost all in his purse
For I know his old gise, and condition
Never to leave, till all his money bee goon
For he hath no money, but what he doth stell
And that woll he play, a way every dell•
I passed by, and then called unto my mind
Sartayde old rekeaninges, that were behind
Between Ienkine &amp; me, whō partly to recōpence
I trust by gods grace, •re I goo hence
This garments, cape, and all other gear•
That now you see, upon me here
I have done oon, all like unto his
For the nonce, and my purpose is
To make Ienkine, believe if I can
That he is not him self, but an other man
For except he hath better loke, than he had
He woll cum hither, stark staring mad
When he shall cum, I wol handle my captain so
Than he shall not well wot, whether too goo
His Maisteris I know, she w•ll him blame
And his Master also, will doo the same
Because that she, of her supper deceived is
For I am sure they have all supped by this
But and if Ienkine, wold hither resort
I trust he and I, should make sum sport
If I had sooner spoken, he wold have sooner been here
For my simithe, I do his voice hear.
A sir I may say, I have been at a fest
I have lost .ii. s•and sir pence at the •est
Mary sir, of this gains I night make no bossed
But the devil goo with all, more have I lost
My name is Careawaie, let all sorrow pass
I woll ere too morrow night be as rich as ever I was
Or at ye forthest within a day or twain
Me Masters pursed, shall paye me again
Therefore hogh careawaie, now wol I sig• hei he•
But bi ye lord now I remember a another thing
By my faith Ienkine my Maisteris and thou
At like to gre, god knows thou
That thou come not, for her incontinent
To bring his to supper, when thou were sent
And now they have all supped, thou wolt shurlie aby
Except thou imagine, sumpretie and crafty lye
For she is as all other women bee
A very cursed shrew, by the blessid Trinity.
And a very Devil, for if she oons begin
To fight, or chide, in a weke she wol not lyne
And a great pleasure she hath, specially now of late
To get poor men, now and then by the pate
For she is an angry piece of flesh, and soon displeasyd
Quikely moved, but not lightly appesed
We use to call her at home, dame Coy
A pretty gingerly pice, god save her and saint Loye
As denty and nice, as an halpeny worth of silver spoons
But vengeable melancholy, in the after noons
She uses for his bodily health, and safe guard
To chid daily oone fit, too supperward
And my Master himself, is worse then she
If he once thoroughly angeryd bee
And a maid we have at home, Aulsoon tripe and goo
Not all London can •hew, such oath•r two
She simpered, she pranks and gets with out faylle
As a peacock that hath spread, and shows his gay tail
Se minceth, she bridled, she swims to and fro
She treads not one here a wry, she tryppeth like a do
A broad in the street, going or cumming homward
She quauerith, and ward•lith, like one in a galliard
Every joint in her body and every part
Oh it is a ioylie wench to myns and divide a fart
She talks, she chatted like a Pie all day
And speaks like a parat Poppagaye
And that as fine, as a small silken thread
Ye and as high as an Eagle can fl for a neade
But it is a spitfull lying girl, and never well
But when she may sum ill ta•l by me tel
She woll I warrant you, a non at the first
Of me imagine, and say the worst.
And what soever she to my maisteris doth say
It is written in the gospel of the same day
Therefore I woll here with my self devise
What I may best say, and in what wise
I may excuse this my long taryeng
That she of my negligence may suspect n•thing
For if the fault of this be found in me
I may give my life for halpenis three
Hic cogitab•ndo similes sedeat.
Let me •lode this month, and I shall not fiend
A b•lt•r devise then now is cume to my mind
Masters woll I say, I am bound by my duty
To see that your womanhod have no injury
For I hear and see, more then you now and then
And your self partly know the want in wiles of men
When wee came yonder, there did I see
My master kiss gentlewomen tow or three
And to come among others my thought bysye
He had a myruayllus great fantasy
A non he commaundyd me to run thens for you
To cume supe there if you wold but I wot not how
My hart grudged mistrusting lest that I being away
My moister wold sum light cast play
Where upon masters, to se the end
I tarried half supper time so god me mend
And besides that there was such other compainye
As I know your maistrisship sets nothing by
Gorges deigns of the corte and galaunts also
with doctors, and other rufflers mo
At last when I thought it time and seasune
I cam too certify you as it was reasune
And by the way whom should I mete
But that most honest Gentleman in the street
Which the last wike was with you here
And made you a banquet, and bouncing cheer
Ah Ienkin {quod} he good spid how forest thou
Mary well god yld it you m••ster {quod} I how do you
How doth thy maisteris is she at home
Ye sir {quod} I and sups all a lone
And but she hath no manner good chere
I am sure she wold gladly have you there
I cannot cum now said he I have business
But thou shalt carry a token from me to thy maistreis
Goo with me too my chaumbre at yone lane end
And I woll a dish of costerds unto her send
I followed him, and was bold by your leave
To receive and bring them here in my sleue
But I wold not for all Englond by Ihesu Christ
That my moister Boungrace hereof wit
Or knew that I should any such gear to you bring
Lest he mistime vs both in sum worse thing
Nor show him nothing of that I before said
For then in did sir I am arrayed
If you doo I may nothing herafter unto you tell
whether I se mi master doo ill or well
That if you now this counsel keep
I wol ease you perchance twice in a wike
you may say you were seek and your head did ache
that you lu••ed not •his night any supper make
Specially with out the doors but thought it best
too abide at home and take your rest
And I will to my moister too bring him home
For you know he wolbe angry if he come alone
this most I say and fa•e it so well
That she shall believe it every dell
Thou say you friends, by the arms of Robin hood
Wol not this excuse be reasonable good
To muse for any beater, great folly it is
For I may make sure rake•ning of this
That and if I wold sit sto•ing this .vii. year
I shall not ells find how to save me all clear
And as you see •or the most part our wits be best
When wee be takyne most vnrediest
But I wol not give for that boy a fly
That hath not al times in store one good lye
And cannot set a good face upon the same
Therefore saint Gorge y• boroue, as it wol let him frame
I woll ieopard a joint, be• as bee may
I have had many like chances, before this day
But I promise you I do curstlie fear
For I feel a vengeable burning in my left ere
And it hath bin a saying, of time long
That sweet mete woll have sour sauce among
And surely I shall have sum ill hape
For my here stands up under my cape
I would knock but I dare not by our lady
I fear hanging where unto no man is hasty
But seeing there is no another remedy
Thus to stand any longer it is but folly.
Hic pulsate ostium.
They bee so far with in, the cannot hear
Soft thy knoking saucy knave, what make thou there
What knave is that? he speaks not too me I trow
And we mete the one of vs is like to have a blow
For now that I am well chafed, and somewhat hot
twenty such could I hew as small as flesh to rote
And surely if I had a knife
This knave should escape hardily with his life
To teach him to ask of me any more
What I make at my own masters door
But if thou come from that gate thou knave
I woll fet thee by the sweat looks so god me save
Woll the horesoon fight in dede by mine honesty
I know no quarrel he hath too me
But I wold I were with in the house
And then I wold not set by him a louse
For I fear and mistrust such quarrelling thiues
See how he begins to strike up his fleues
His arse makes buttons now, and who lustith to feale
Shall find his hart creping out at his heel
Or ells lying hidden in sum corner of his hose
If it be not already dropped out of his nose
For as I doubt not but you have hard beforne
A more dastard covered knave was never borne
The devil set the house a fire, I trow it is a cursed
When a man •ath most hast he spedith worst
If I bee robed, or slain, or any harm geate
The fault is in them that doth not me in let
And I durst ieoperd, an hunderīd pound
That sum bauderie might now within be found
But except sum of them come the sooner
I shall knock such a peal, that al englond shall wō•er
Knoke at the gate hardily again if thou dare
And seeing thou wolt not bye fair words beware
Now fistes, me thinks yesterday .vii. years past
That four men a sleep at my fete you cast
And this same day you did no manner good
Nor were not washen in warm blot
What whoreson is this that washith in warm blot
Sum devil broken loose, out of hell for wood
Four hath he slain, and now well I see
That it must be my chance the fifth to bee
But rather then thus shamfullye too be slain
wold Christ my friends had hanged me being but years .ii
And yet if I take good hart and be bold
Percace he wolbe more sobre and could
Now hands bestur you about his lips and face
And streak out all hi• teeth without any grace
Gentleman• are you disposed to ear any fist mete
I have supped I thank you sir and list not to eat
Give it to them that are haungrie if you be wise
Yet shall do a man of your d•et no harm to sup twice
This shall be your Chise, to make your merdigest
For I tell you these hands weighith of the best
I shall never escape see how he waghith his hands
with a stroke they will lay a 〈◊〉 in our lady b•an•
And this day yet they have done no g••d at all
Ere you assay thē on me, I pray thee lame thē on ye wall
But speak you all this in earnest, or in game
If yo• be angry with me truly you are to blame
For have you any just quarrel to me
Eer thou and I part that wol I show thee
Or have I done you any manner displeasure
Ere thou and I part thou shalt know, y• moist besure
By my faith if thou be angry without a cause
You shall have a mends made with a cople of strauss
By thee I set what soever thou art
But for thy displeasure I care not a fart
May a man demand whose servant you bee
My masters servant I am for verity
what busynes have you at this place now
Nay mary tell me what busynes hast thou
For I am commanded for to watch &amp; give diligence
That in my good moister Boungraces absence
No misfortune may happen to his house certain
well now I am cume, you may go hens again
And thank them yt so much for my moister hath done
Sewing them yt the servants of y• house be cume home
For I am of the house, and now in woll I goo
I cannot tell whether thou be of the house or no
But goo no ne'er, lest I handle thee like a stranger
Thank no man but thy self, if thou be in any danger
Mary I defy thee, and planly unto thee tell
That I am a servant of this house, and here I dwell
Now so god me snache, but thou goo thee ways
While thou may, for this forty d•yes
I •hall make thee not able to goo nor ride
But in a dungcart or a whilberow lying on on side
I am a servant of this house by these .x. bons
No more prating but geat thee hens at towns
Why my master hath sent me home in his message
Pike and walk a knave, here a way is no passage
What wilt thou let me from my noun masters house
Be tredging, or in faith you •ere me a souse
Here my master and I have our habitation
A•d hath continually dwelled in this mansyon
At the least this doos•n years and od
And here wol we end our lives by the grace of god
Why then where shall my moister and I dwell
At the Devil if you lust, I can not tell
In nominee patris, now this gear doth pass
For a little before supper here our house was
And this day in ye morning I wol on a book swer
That my moister and I both dwelleyd here
Who is thy master tell me with out lye
And thine own name also let me know shortly
For my masters all, let me have the blame
If this knave know his master or his own name
My masters name is moister Boungrace
I have dwelled with him a lunge space
And I am ienkin Careawaye his page
What ye drunken knave begin you to rage
Take that, art thou moister Boungracis page
If I be not, I have made a very good viage
Dare thou too my face say thou art I
I would it were true and no lye
For then thou should smart, and I should bet
Where as now I do all the blows get
And is moister Boungrace thy moister doest y• •hen say
I woll swear on a book, he was once this day
And for that thou shalt sum what have
Base•se thou presume, like a saucy lying knave
To say my moister is thine? who is thy moister now?
By my truth sir who so ever please you
I am your own, for you beat me so
As no man but my master should doo
I woll handle thee better if faut be not in fist
Help save my life masters for ye passion of christ
Why thou lousy thief doest thou cry and rare
No faith I woll not cry one whit more
Save my life help, or I am slain
Ye doest thou make a romeringe yet a gain
Did not I bide the hold thy peace
In faith now I leave crieng, now I seas help, help,
Who is thy moister
Master Boungrace
I woll make the change ye song, ere wee pas this place
For he is my moister, and a gain to see I say
That I am his ienkin Careawaye
Who art thou now tell me plain
No body, but whom please you certain
Thou saydest even now thy name was Careawaie
I cry you mercy sir, and forgiveness pray
I said a miss because it was so too day
And thought it should have continued always
Like a foal as I am and a drunken knave
But in faith sir ye se all the wit I have
Therefore I beseech you do me no more blame
But give me a new moister, and an other name
For it wold grieve my hart so help me god
To run about the streets like a maisterlis nod
I am he that thou saydest thou were
And moister boungrace is my moister yt dweleth hear
thou art no point Careawaye thy wits do thee faylle
Ye mary sir you have bett them down into my taylle
But sir might I be bold to say on thing
Without any bloues, and without any beating
Truce for a while say one what thy lust
May a man too your honest by your word trust
I pray you swear by the mass you woll do me no ill
By my faith I promise pardon thee I woll
What and you keep no promise. In juggler, then vpō ca•
I pray god light as much or more as hath on y• to day
Now dare I speak so mote I thee
Moister boungrace is my moister, and the name of me
is ienken careaway, jack juggler. What says thou so
And if thou wilt strike me, and break thy promise, doo
And beat on me, till I stink, and till I dye
And yet woll I still say that I am I
This bedlam knave without dought is mad
No by god for all that I am a wise lad
And can cale to remembrance every thing
That I did this day, sith my uprising
For went not I with my master to day
Early in the morning to the Tenis play?
At noon while my moister at his dinner sate
Played not I at Dice at the gentylmans gate
Did not I wait on my moister to supper ward
And I thīke I was not chaūged y• way hōward
Or ells if thou think I lye
Ask in the street of them that I came bye
And sith that I cam hither into your presens
what man living could carry me hens
I remember I was sent to fetch my maisteris
And what I devised to save me harmless
Doo not I speak now is not this my hand
Be not these my feet yt on this ground stand?
Did not this other knave her knoke me about ye heed?
And beat me till I was almost dede?
How may it then bee, that he should bee I?
Or I not my self it is a shamfull lye
I woll home to our house, whosoever say nay
For surely my name is ienkin Careawaye
I wol make thee say otherwise ere we depart if we can
Nay that woll I not in faith for no man
Except thou tell me what I thou hast done
Ever sith five of the cloak this after noon:
Rehearse me all that with out any lye
And then I woll confess that thou art I
When my moister came to the gentylmās place
He cōmaunded me too rune home a great pace
Too fet thither my maisteris and by the way
I did a good while at the bukelers play
Then came I by a wife that did costerds sell
And cast down his basket fair and well
And gathered as many as I could get
And put them in my sleue here they bee yet
How the devil should they cume there
For I did them all in my own sleue bear
He l•eth not a word in all this
Nor doth in any one point myse
For ought I se yet between ernest and game
I must go seek me a another name
But thou might see al this, tel the rest that is behind
And there I know I shall thee a liar find
I ran thence homeward a contrary way
And wheth•r I stopped there or nay
I could tell if me lusts a good token
But it may not very well be spoken
No may I pray thee let no man that here
But tell it me privily in mine ere
I thou lost all thy money at dice christ give it his curse
well and truly pycked before out of an other mās p•rs
Gods body horizon thief who told thee that same
Sum cunning devil is with in thee payne of shame
In nominee patris, god and our blessed lady
Now and evermore save me from thy company
How now art thou Careawaye or not
By the lord I doubt, but say thou nay to that
Ye mary I tell thee care away is my name
And by these ten bones mine is the same
Or ells tell me if I be not hee
What my name from hensforth shall bee
By my faith the same that it was before
When I lust too be Careawaye no more
Look well upon me, and thou shalt see as now
That I am ienkyne Careawaye and not thou
Look well a pone me, and by every thing
Thou shalt well know that I make no leasing.
I se it is so without any doubt
But how the devil came it a bout
W•o so in England lokethe on him stately
Sall perceive plainly that he is I
I have scene my self a thousand times in a glass
But so like myself as he is never was
He hath in every point my clothing &amp; mi gear
My head, my cape, my shirt and noted hear
And of the same colour, my yes, nose and lips
Much 〈…〉 no•e, feet, leges, and hippos
Of the same statute, and hight and age
And is in every point moister Boungrace page
That if he have a hole in his tail
He is even I mine own self without any fail
And yet when I remember I wot not how
The same mā yt I have ever bine me thinks I am now
I know mi moister, &amp; his house, &amp; my five wits I have
Why then should I give credence to this foolish knave
That nothing entendith but me delude and mooke
For whom should I fear at my masters gate to knoke
Think t•ou I have said all this in game
Goo or I shall send the hens in the devils name
A void thou lousy lurden &amp; precious stinking slave
that n•there thy name know nor can any moister have
wine shaken, pilorye peepours, of lice not without a peck
Hens or by gods precious I shall break thy neck
Then master I beseech you heartily take the payne
If I be found in any place too bring me to me again
Now is not this a wonderful case
That no man should lease him self so in any place
Have any of you harde of such a thing here to fore
No nor never shall I dare say from hensforth any more
while he muses an judges him self upon
I wo•l steal a way for a while and let him a loon
Good lord of heaven, where did I my self leave
Or who did me of my name by the way bereave
For I am sure of this in my mind
That I did in no place leave my self byhinde
If I had my name played a way at dice
Or had sold my self to any man at a price
Or had made a fray and had lost it in fighting
Or it had bin stolen from me sleaping
It had bin a matter and I wold have kept patience
But it spiteth my hart to have lost it by such open nag∣ligence
Ah thou horizon drowsy drunken sot
Yt were an alms died to walk thy cote
And I shrew him that wold for thee be sorry
Too see thee well curried by and by
And by Christ if any man wold it doo
I my self wold help there too
For a man may see thou horizon goose
Thou would lyse thine arse if it were loose
Albeit I would never the died believe
But that the thing it self doth show and privy
There was never Ape so like unto an Ape
As he is to me in feature, and shape
But what woll my moister say trow ye
When he shall this gear here and see
Will he know me think yo•, when he shall se me
If he do not a another woll as good as he
But where is that other I? whether is he gon
To my master by cock•s precius passion
Either to put me out of my place
Or too accuse me to my moister Boungrace
But I woll after as fast as I can flee
I trust to be there as soon as hee
That if my master be not ready home to come
I woll be here again as fast as I can rune
I• any wise to speak with my maysteris
Or ells I shall never escape hanging dubtles
I shall not sup this night full well I see
For as yet no body •umithe for to fet me•
But good enough let me alone
I woll bee even with them every chone
I say nothing, but I think sum what I wis
Sum there bee that shall here of this
Of al unkind &amp; churlish husbands this is ye cast
To let there wives se• at home and fast
While they bee forth and make good cheer
Pastime, and sport, as now he doth there
But if I were a wise woman, as I am a mom
I should make my self as good chere at home
But if he have thus unkindly served me
I woll not forget it this months three
And if I west ye fault were in him, I pray god I be ded
But he should have such a kyrie, ere he went too bed
As he never had before in all his life
Nor any man ells have had of his wy•e
I would rate him and shake him after such a sort
As should be to him a corrosive, full little to his cumforte
If I may be so bold by your ma•sterishps lyeens
As too speak and show my mind and sentence
I think of this you may the boy thank
For I know that he plays you many a like prank
And that would you say, if you knew as mu•ch as wee
That his daily conversation and byhauiore s•e
For if you comm•••d him to goo speak with sum one
Yt is an hour ere he wolbe gone
Then woll he rune forth, and play in the street
And cume a gain and say that he cannot with him mete
Nay, nay, it is his masters play
He serves me so almost every third day
But I wolbe even with him as god give me joy
And yet the fault may be• in the boy
As ungracious a graft•• met I thrive
As any goes on gods g••••d a•yue
My wit is breched in such a brake
That I cannot devise what way is best to take
I was almost as fare as my moister is
But then I began to remember •his
And to cast the worst as on in •ere
•f he chance to see me and keep me there
Till he cum him self, &amp; speak with mi mistress
Than am I like to bee in shrewd distress
yet were I better thought I to turn home again
And first speak with her certain
Cocks body yonder she stands at the door
Now is it worse then it was before
Wold christ I could get again out of his sight
For I see be her look she is disposed to fight
Bi ye lord she hath there an angry shrews lo•e
Lo yonder cumithe that unhappy hook
God save you maysteris doo you know me well
Cume ne'er hither unto me, and I shall thee tell
Why thou nought vyllan is that thy gyse
To gest with thy maisteris in such wise
take that to begin with, and god before
when thy moister cumith home thou shalt have more
For he told me when he forth went
That thou shouldest cume bake a gain inconfinente
To bring me to supper where he now is
And thou hast plaid by the way, &amp; they have don bi this
But no force I shall thou may trust me
Teach all naughty knaves to beware by thee
For sothe maisteris if you knew as much as I
ye would not be with me half so angry
For the fault is neither in mi moister nor in me nor you
But in an other knave that was here even now
And his name was ienkin Careawaie
What I see my man is disposed to play
I wine he be drunken or mad I make god a vou
Nay I have bin made sobre and tame I now
I was never so handled before in all my life
I would every man in England had so beat me his wife
I have forgotten with tossing by the here
What I devised to say a little ere
Have I lost my supper this night through thy negligēce
Nay then were I a knave mysteries, saving your reuerēce
Why I am sure that by this time it is done
Ye that it is more then an our agony
And was not thou sent-to feache me theyth•r
Yes and had cume right quiklie hither
But that by the way I had a great fall
And my name, body shape legs and all
And meat with one, that from me did it ••elle
But be god he and I sum bloues did deal
I would he were now before your gate
For you wold poumile him ioylile about the pate
Truly this wage •astie is either drunken or mad
Never man soffred so much wrong as I had
But maisteris I should say a thing to you
Tarry it wol cum to my remembrance even now
I must net•s use a substantial premeditacion
For the matter lies gretylie me a pone
I beseech your maisterishipe of pardon and forgiveness
Desyering you to impute it to my simple &amp; rude dull•nes
I have forgotten what I have thought to have said
And am thereof full ill a paid
But when I lost my self I knew very well
I lost also that I should you tell
Why thou wretched villen doest thou me scorn and moke
To make me to these folk a laufyng stock
Ere thou go out of my hands y• shalt have sum thing
And I woll rekine better in the morning
And if you beat me maysteris a vise you
For I am none of your servant now
That other I is now your page
And I am no long•r in your bondage
Now walk precious thife get thee out of my sight
And I charge thee cum in my presens no more this night
Get thee hens and wait on thy moister at once
Mary sir this is handeling for the noons
I wold I had bin hanged before y• I was lost
I was never this canuased and tossed
That if my moister on his part also
Handle me as my maisteris and the other I do
I shall surely be killed between them three
And all the devils in hell shall not save me
But yet if the other I might have with me part
All this wold never grieve my heart
Thou say you masters I pray you tell
Have not I requited my merchant well
Have not I handelyd him after a good sort
Had it not bin pity to have lost this sport
A none his moister on his behalphe
You shall see how he woll handle the calphe
if he thoroughly angered bee
He woll make him smart so mot I thee
I wold not for the price of a new pair of shone
That any part of this had bin vndune
But now I have reu•nged my quarrel
I woll go do of this mine apparel
And now let Careawaye be Careawaye again
I have done with that name now certain
Exc•pt perauenture I shall take the self same wed
Sum other time again for a like cause and need
Why then darist thou to presume too tell me
That I know is no wise possible for to bee
Now by my truth master I have told you no lie
And all these folks knowith as well as I
I had nosooner knoked at the gate
But straight ways he had me by the pate
Therefore if you bet me till I fart &amp; shit again
you shall not cause me for any payne
But I woll affirm as I said before
That when I came ne'er a another stood at ye door.
Why ye naughty villain dare yt affirm to me
that which was never scene nor hereafter shall be
That one man may have too bodies &amp; two faces
And yt one man at on time may be in too plays
Tell me drankest thou any where by the way
I shreue me if I drāke any more thē twice to day
Till I met even now with that other I
And with him I supped and drank truly
But as for you if you gave me drink and meat
As oftentimes as you do me beat
I were the best fed page in all this City
But as touching that, you have on me no pity
And not only I but all that do you sarue
For meat and dry•ke may rather starve
What you saucy malyp•rt known
Begin you with your moister to prat andraue
your tongue is liberal and all out of frame
I must nets coung•r it and make it tame
where is ye other Careawai • thou said was here
Now by my christendom sir I wōt ne'er
Why can thou find no man to moke but me
I moke you not moister so mo• I thee
Every word was true that I you told
Nay I know toys and prank of old
And now thou art not satisfied nor content
Without regard of my biddinges and commaūdiment
To ha•e played by the way as a lewd know &amp; negligēt
When I thee on my message home sent
But also would willingly me delude &amp; moke
And make me to all wise men a laughing stoke
showing me such things as in no wise be may
To ye intent thy leudues my turn to jest &amp; play
Therefore if you speak any such thing to me agaīe
I promise it shall be unto thy payne
Loo is not he in miserable ca•e
That sarueth such a moister in any place
that with force wol compel him ye thing to deny
That he knows true, and hath sine with his ye
Was it not troiest thouthine own shadoe
My shadoo could never have beten me so
Why by what reason possible may such a thing bee
Nay I marvel and wonder at it more than ye
And at the first it did me curstelye mea•e
Nor I wold mine own yes in no wise believe
Until that other I beat me so
That he made me believe it whither i wold or no
And if he had your self now within his reach
He wold make you say so too or ells be shite your breach
I durst a good mede, and a wager lay
That thou laiest down and sleppest by the way
And •remidall this that thou haste me told
Day there you lye master if I might be so bold
But we rise so early that if I had
I had done well and a wise lad
yet master I would you under stood
T•at I have all ways bin trusty and good
And fly as fast as a bear in a cage
When so ever you send me in your message
in faith as for this that I have told you
I saw and felt it as waking as I am now
For I had no sooner knocked at the gate
But the other I knave had me by the pate
A•d I durst to you one a book swear
That he had bin watching for me there
Lunge ere I came hidden in sum privy place
E•en for the nonce too have me by the face
Why then thou speak not with my wife
No that I did not my•la by my life
Until that other I was gone
And then my moister•s sent me after a no•e
To weight on you home in the devils name
I wene the devil never so beat his dame
And where became that other Careawaye
By mine honesty sir I cannot say
But I warrant he is now not far hens
He is here among this company for .xl. pens
Hence at tons seek and smell him out
I shall rape thee on the lying knanes snought
I woll not bee deludyd with such a glossing lye
Nor give credens till I see it with my oune iye
Truly good sir by your maistershipps favour
I cannot well find a knave by the savour
Many here smell strong but none so rank as he
A stronger scented knave then he was cannot bee
But sir if he be happily found anon
What a mēds shall I have for yt you have me don
If he may befound I shall walk his cote
Ye for our lady sake sir I beseech you spare hī not
For it is sum false knave withouten doubt
I had rath•r thē .xl. pens we could find him out
For if a man may believe a glase
Euin my very oune self it was.
And here he was but euyn right now
And steped a way suddenly I wat not how
Of such a other thīg I have nether hard no scene
By our blyssyd lady heaven q•en
Plainly it was thy shadow that thou did se
For in faith the other thing is not possible to be
Yes in good faith sir by your leave
I know it was I by my apples in my sleue
And speaks as like me as ever you harde
Such here, such a Cape, such Hose and cote
And in every thing as just as .iiii. pens to a grot
That if he were here you should well see
That you could not discern nor know hī frō me
For think you that I do not my self know
I am not so foolish a knave I trow
Let who woll look him by and by
And he woll depose upon a book that he is I
And I dare well say you woll say the same
For he called him self by my own name
And told me all that I have done
Sith five of the cloak this after none
He could tell when you were to supper sete
you send me home my maisteris to fete
And showed me al things that I did by ye way
What was that
How I did at the Bukelers play
And whā I scattered a basket of apples frō a ••al
And gathered them into my sleue all
And how I played after that also
Thou shalt have by therefore so mote I go
Is that the guise of a trusty page
To play when he is sent on his masters message
Lay on and spare not for the love of christ
Ioll his head to a post, and favour your fist
Now for my sake sweet hart spare &amp; favour your hand
•nd lay him• about the ribs with this wand
Now mercy that I ask of you both twain
Save my life and let me not be slain
I have had beting enough for one day
That a mischief take the other me Careawayne
That if ever he cume to my hands again
I wis it shall be to his payne
But I marvel greatly by our lord Ihesus
How he I escaped, I me beat me thus
And is not he I an unkind knave
That woll no more pity on my self have
Here may you see, evidently iwis
That in him me no drop of houestie is
Now a ••ngaūce light on such a churls knave
That no more love toward my self have
I knew very well swite hart &amp; said right now
That no fault thereof should be in you
No truly good h•dfelow, I were then much unkind
if you at any time should be out of my mind
Surely I have of you a great treasure
For you do all things which may be to my pleasure
I am sorry that your chance hath now bin so ill
I would gladly bin vnsupped, so you had your fill
But goo we in pigesnie that you may sup
you bane cause now to thank this same hang up
For had not he bin you had faryd very well
I bequeath him with a hot vengeance to the devil of hell
And heartily I beseech him that hanged on the rode
That he never eat nor drink, that may do him good
And that he dye a shameful death saving my charity
I pray god send him such prosperity
That hath caused me to have all this business
But yet sirs you see the charity of my masters
She lives after a wonderful charitable facion
For I assure you she is always in this passion
And scacelye on day throughout the hole year
She woll wish any man better chere
And sum time if she well angered bee
I pray god (woll she say) y• house may sink under me
But masters if you happen to see that other I
As that you shall it is not very likely
Nor I woll not desire you for him purposely to look
For it is an incomparable unhappy hook
And if it be I, you might happen to seek
And not find me out in an hole week
For when I was wont to rune a way
I used not to cum a gain in less thā a month or tway
Houbeit for all this I think it be not I
For to show the matter in died truly
I never use to rune away in winter nor in vere
But all ways in such time and season of the year
When honey lies in the hives of Bees
And all manner fruit falls from the trees
As Apples, Nuts, Peers, and plummes also
Whereby a boy may live a broad a month or two
This cast do I use I woll not with you fain
Therefore I wonder if he be I certain
But and if he be, and you mete me a broad by chance
Send me home to my waister with a vengeance
And show him if he cume not ere to morrow night
I woll never receive him again if I might
And in the mean time I woll give him a groat
That woll well and thryftelye walk his cote
For a more ungracious knave is not even now
Between this place and Calycow
Nor a more frantic mad knave in bedelem
Nor a more folle hence to Iherusalem
That if to cume again, parcace he shall refuse
I woll continue as I am and let him choose
And but he cum the sooner by our lady bright
He shall lye without the doors all night
For I woll shit up the gate, and get me to bed
For I promise you I have a very giddy heed
I need no supper for this night
Nor would eat no meat though I might
And for you also moister I think I best
you go to bed, and take your rest
For who of you had bin handled as I have ben
wold not be long out of his bed I when
No more woll I but steal out of s•light
I pray god give you all good night
And send you better hape, and fortune
Thē to less your self home ward as I have don
Somewhat it was says the proverb old
That the Cat winked when here iye was out
That is to say• no tale can be told
But that sum English may be piked thereof out
if so to search the latin &amp; ground of it men will go about
As thy• 〈◊〉 interlude yt before you hath bine rehearsed
May signify sum further meaning if it be well searched
Such is the fashion of the world now a days
That the simple innosaintes as deluded
And an hundred thousand divers ways
By subtle and crafty means shamefully abused.
And by strength force, and violence oft times compelled
To believe and say the moune is made of a grene c••se
Or ells have great harm, and parcace their life less
And an old saying it is, that most times might
Force, strength, power, &amp; colorable subtlety
Do the oppre•se, dybare, ouercum and defeat right
Though yt cause stand never so greatly against equity
and ye truth thereof be knowē for never so y it cert••ntye
ye &amp; the pore semple innocent yt hath had wrong &amp; in•ur
Must cal ye other his good moister for showing him such mercy
And as it is daily syne for fere of farther disprofite
He must that man his best friend and moister call
Of whom he never received any manner benefit
And at whose hand he never han any good at all
And must grant, affirm, or deny, what so ever he shall
He must say the Croue is whight, if he be so cōmaūded
ye and that he him self is into a another body changed
He must say he did a miss, though he 〈…〉 d••ffee•
He must ask forgiveness, where he did not d••part
Or ells be in troble, care and misery with out end
And he cast in sum arrierage, without •y gre•e
And that thing he saw done before his 〈◊〉 •ace
He must by compulsion, sufelie de••e
And for fear whether he woll or not 〈◊〉 tongue 〈…〉
And in every faculty, this thing is put in 〈◊〉
And is so universal that I need no one to name
And as I fere is like evermore to endure
For it is in all faculties a coniuryie sports and game
The weaker to say as yt strōger bids, or to have •lai•
As a cunning sophist woll by argument bring to pass
That the rude shall confess, and gre••• himself an 〈◊〉
And this is ye daily exoe•••e, and practise of their scoles
And not among them only, but also among all others
The stronger to compel and wake •ee•e simple foals
To say as they command them in all manner matiers
I woll name none particular, but set them all together
with out any exception, for I pray you show me one
Among al in the world that vsethe not such fission
He that is stronger and more of power and might
If he be disposed to revenge his cau••
woll soon pike a quarrel be it wrong b• right
To the inferior and we 〈◊〉 for a 〈◊〉 of strives
And woll against him so extremely lay the laws
That he wol put him to the worse, other by false injury
Or by some craft and subtility, or ells by plain teranie
As you saw right now, by example plain
An other fellow being a counterfeit page
Brought the gentylmans servant out of his brain
And made him grant ye him self was fallen in dotage•
Bary•g him self in haud that he did rage
And when he could not bring that to pass by reason
He made him grant it, and say by compulsion
Therefore happy are they that can beware
Into whose hands they fall by any such chance
which if they do, they hardly escape care
Troble, Misery, and woeful greuaunce
And thus I make an end, cōmitting you to his gidaū
That made, &amp; redeemed vs al, and to you yt be now heart
I pray god grant, and send many a good new year.

THE silent night that brings the
quiet pause,
From painful travails of the
weary Day:
Prolonges my careful thoughts
and makes me blame
The slow Juror that so for love or shame
Doth lunge delay to show her blushing face,
And now the Day renews my griefull plaint.
My gracious Lady and mother dear,
Pardon my grief, for your so grieved mind
To ask what cause torments so your heart.
So great a wrong and so unjust despite,
Without all cause against all course of kind.
Such causeles wrong and so unjust despite,
May have redress, or at the least revenge.
Neither my Son, such is the froward will,
The person such, such my mishap and thine.
Mine know I none, but grief for your distress:
Yes: mine for thine my son: A father? no:
In kind a Father, but not in kindliness.
My Father: why? I know nothing at all,
Wherein I have misdone unto his Grace.
Therefore, the more unkind to thee and me.
For knowing well (my son) the tender love▪
That I have ever borne and bear to thee,
He grieved thereat, is not content alone,
To spoil thee of my sight my chiefest Joy,
But thee, of the birth, right and Heritage
Causeles, unkindly and in wrongful wise,
Against all Law and right he will bereave,
Half of his kingdom he will give away.
To whom?
Even to Porrex his younger son
Whose growing Pride I do so sore suspect,
That being raised to equal Rule with thee,
Me thinks I see his envious heart to swell
Fyllde with Disdain and with ambitious Pride
The end the Gods do know, whose Aulters I
Full oft have made in vain of Cattle slain,
To send the sacred smoke to Heavens Throne,
For thee my son if things so succeed,
As now my Jealous mind misdemeth sore.
Madame leave care and careful plaint for me.
Just hath my Father ben to every wight,
His first unjustice he will not extend
To me I trust, that give no cause thereof.
My brothers pride shall hurt him self, not me.
So grant the Gods: But yet thy father so
Hath firmly fixed his vnmoued mind
That plaints &amp; prayers can no whit avail,
For those have I assayed, but even this day,
He will endeavour to procure assent
Of all his Counsel to his fond devise.
Their Ancestors from race to race have borne
True faith to my forefathers and their seed,
I trust they eke will bear the like to me.
There rests all, but if they fail thereof,
And if the end bring forth an evil success
On them and theirs the mischief shall befall,
And so I pray the Gods requite it them,
And so they will, for so is wont to bee
When Lords and trusted Rulers under kings
To please the present fancy of the Prince,
With wrong transpose the course of governance
Murders, mischief, or civil sword at length,
Or mutual treason, or a just revenge,
When right succeeding Line returns again
By Ioues just Judgment and deserved wrath
Brings them to civil and reproachful death,
And roots their names &amp; kindredes frō the earth.
Mother content you, you shall see the end.
The end? thie end I fear, Jove end me first.
MY Lords whose grave advise &amp; faithful aide
Have long upheld my Honour &amp; my Realm
And brought me from this age from tender years.
Guiding so great estate with great renown:
Now more imports me the erst to use
Your faith and wisdom whereby yet I reign,
That when by death my lief and rule shall cease,
The kingdom yet may with vnbroken course,
Have certain Prince, by whose undoubted right,
Your wealth and peace, may stand in quiet stay,
And eke that they whom Nature hath prepared,
In time to take my place in Princely Seat,
While in their Fathers time their pliant youth
Yields to the frame of skilful governance
May so be taught and trained in noble Arts,
As what their fathers which have reigned before
Have with great fame derived down to them
With honour they may leave unto their seed:
And not be taught for their unworthy life,
And for their Liveless swaruynge out of kind,
Worthy to lose what Law and kind them gave
But that they may preserve the cōmon peace,
The cause that first began and still maintains
The Lineal course of kings inheritance,
For me, for mine, for you, and for the state
Whereof both I and you have charge and care.
Thus do I mean to use your wonted faith
To me and mine, and to your native Land,
My Lords be plain without all wry respect
Or poisonous craft to speak in pleasing wise,
Lest as the blame of ill succeeding things
Shall light on you, so light the harms also.
Your good acceptance so (most noble king)
Of such your faithfulness as heretofore
We have employed in duties to your Grace,
And to this Realm whose worthy head you are,
Well proves that neither you mistrust at all,
Nor we shall need no boasting wise to show,
Our truth to you, nor yet our wakeful care
For you, for yours, and for our native Land,
Wherefore (O king) I speak for one as all,
Sith all as one do bear you eagle faith:
Doubt not to use their Counsels and their aides
Whose honours, goods &amp; lives are whole avowed
To serve, to aid, and to defend your Grace.
My Lords I thank you all. This is the case
Ye know, the Gods, who have the sovereign care
For kings, for kingdoms, and for cōmen weals,
Gave me two sons in my more lusty Age,
Who now in my deceiving years are grown
Well towards ryper state of mind and strength,
To take in hand some greater Princely charge,
As yet they live and spend their hopeful days,
With me and with their Mother here in Courts
Their age now asks other place and trade,
And mine also doth ask an other change,
Theirs to more travail, mine to greater ease:
When fatal death shall end my mortal life,
My purpose is to leave unto them twain
The Realm divided into two sundry parts:
The one Ferrex mine elder son shall have,
The other shall the other Porrex rule
That both my purpose may more framelie stand,
And eke that they may better rule their charge,
I mean forthwith to place them in the same:
That in my life they may both learn to rule,
And I may Joy to see their ruling well.
This is in sōme, what I would have ye way:
First whether ye allow my whole devise,
And think it good for me, for them, for you,
And for our Country, mother of vs all:
And if ye like it and allow it well,
Than for their guiding and their governance,
Show sorthe such means of circumstance,
As ye think meet to be both known and kept:
Lot, this is all, now tell me your advise.
And this is much, and asks great advise,
But for my part my Sovereign Lord and king
This do I think your Majesty doth know,
Howe under you in Justice and in peace,
Great wealth and Honour, long we have enjoyed
So as we can not seem with greedy minds
To wish for change of Prince or governance,
But if ye like your purpose and devise,
Our liking must be deemed to proceed,
Of rightful reason, and of heedful care,
Not for our selves, but for our cōmen state:
Sith our own state doth need no better change
I think in all as erst your Grace hath said:
First when you shall vnlode your aged mind,
Of heavy care and troubles manifold,
And lay the same upon my Lords your sons
Whose growing years may bear the burden long
And lunge I pray the Gods to grant it so:
And in your life while you shall so behold
Their rule, their virtues and their noble deeds,
Such as their kind behighteth to vs all,
Great be the profits that shall grow thereof,
Your age in quiet shall the longer last,
Your lasting age shall be their longer stay,
For cares of kings, that rule as you have ruled
For public wealth and not for private joy,
Do wast man life and hasten crooked age,
With furrowed face and with enfeebled limbs,
To draw on creeping Death a swifter pace.
They two yet young shall bear the party reign
With greater ease, than one now old alone
Can weld the whole, for whom much harder is
with lessened strength the double weight to bear
Your eye, your Counsel, and the grave regard
Of Fathers, yea of such a fathers name,
Now at beginning of their sondred reign,
When it is hazard of their whole success,
Shall bridle so their force of youthful heats,
And so restrain the rage of insolence,
Which most assails the young and noble minds,
And so shall guide and train in tempered stay
Their yet greene bending wits with reverent awe
And now inured with virtues at the first.
Custom (O king) shall bring delightfulness
By use of Virtue, Vice shall grow in hate,
But if you so dispose it, that the day,
Which ends your life, shall first begin their reign
Great is the peril, what will be the end,
When such beginning of such liberties
Void of such states as in your lief do lye,
Shall leave them to free random of their will
An open pray to traitorous flattery,
The greatest pestilence of noble youth:
Which peril shall be past, if in your life,
Their tempered youth with aged fathers awe
Be brought in ur of skilful staidness
And in your life, their lives disposed so,
Shall length your noble lief in ioyfulnes.
Thus think I yt your grace hath wisely thought
And that your tender care of cōmen weal,
Hath bred this thought, so to divide your Land
And plant your sons to bear the present rule
While you yet live to see their ruling well,
That you may longer live by joy therein.
What further means behooveful are and meet
At great leisure may your Grace devise,
When all have said, and when we be agreed
If this be best to part the Realm in twain,
And place your sons in present government
Whereof as I have plamely said my mind,
So would I here the rest of all my Lords.
In part I think as have ben said before,
In part again my mind is otherwise
As for dividing of this Realm in twain
And lotting out the same in eagle parts,
To either of my Lords your Graces sons,
That think I best for this your Realms behosf,
For profit and advancement of your sons,
And for your comfort and your honour eke:
But so to place them while your life do last,
To yield to them your Royal governance,
To be aboue them only in the name
Of father, not in kingly state also,
I think not good for you, for them, nor vs,
This kingdom since the bloody civil field
Where Morgan slain did yield his conquered part
Unto his Cousins sword in Camberlande
Contains all that meanwhile did suffice,
Three noble sons of your forefather Brute,
So your two sons, it may also suffice,
The more the stronger, if they gre in one:
The smaller compass that the Realm doth hold
The easier is the swey thereof to weld,
The nearer Justice to the wronged poor,
The smaller charge, and yet enough for one.
And when the Region is divided so
That Brethren be the Lords of either part,
Such strength doth nature knit between the both.
In sundry bodies by conjoined love
That not as two, but one of doubled force,
Eche is to other as a sure defence,
The Nobleness and glory of the one
Doth sharpe the courage of the others mind
With virtuous envy to contend for praise,
And such an egalnes hath nature made,
Between the Brethren of one Fathers seed,
As an unkindly wrong it seems to bee,
To throw the other Subject under feet
Of him, whose Peer he is by course of kind,
And nature that did make this egalnes,
Oft so repines at so great a wrong,
That oft she raises up a grudging grief,
In younger Brethren at the elders state:
Whereby both towns &amp; kingdoms have be rased
And famous stocks of Royal blood destroyed:
The Brother that should be the Brothers aide
And have a wakeful care for his defence,
Gapes for his death, &amp; blames the lingering years
That brings not forth his end with faster course
And oft impatient of so lunge delays,
With hateful slaughter he presents the fates
And keeps a just reward for Brothers blood,
With endless vengeance on his stock for aye:
Such mischiefs here are wisely met withal:
If eagle state may nourish eagle love,
Where none hath cause to grudge at others good,
But now the head to stoup beneth them both,
No kind, no reason, no good ordre bears,
And oft it hath ben seen, that where Nature
Hath ben preuerted in disordered wise,
When Fathers cease to know that they should rule
And Children cease to know they should obey,
And often our unkindly tendrenes,
As Mother of unkindly Stubbornes:
I speak not this in envy or reproach,
As if I grudged the glory of your sons,
Whose honour I beseech the Gods to increase:
Nor yet as if I thought there did remain,
So filthy Cankers in their noble breasts,
Whom I esteem (which is their greatest praise,
Undoubted children of so good a king.
Only I mean to show my certain Rules,
Which kind hath graft within the mind of man
That Nature hath her ordre and her course,
Which (being broken) doth corrupt the state
Of minds and things even in the best of all
My Lords your sons may learn to rule of you
Your own example in your noble Court
Is fittest Guyder of their youthful years,
If you desire to seek some present Joy
By sight of their well ruling in your life,
See them obey, so shall you see them rule,
Who so obeys not with humbleness
Will rule without rage and with insolence
Lunge may they rule I do beseech the Gods,
But lunge may they learn ere they begin to rule
If kind and fates would suffer I would wish
Them aged Princes and immortal kings:
Wherefore most noble king I well assent,
Between your sons y• you divide your Realm.
And as in kind, so match them in degree
But while the Gods prolongue your Royal life
Prolongue your reign, for thereto live you here,
And therefore have the Gods so lunge forborne
To join you to them selves, that still you might
Be Prince and father of our cōmon weal:
They when they se your children ripe to rule
Will make them rome, &amp; will remove you hence,
That yours in right ensuing of your life
May rightly honour your mortal name.
Your wonted true regard of faithful hearts,
Makes me (O king) the bolder to presume
To speak what I conceive within my breast,
Although the same do not agree at all
With that which other here my Lords have said
Nor which your self have seemed best to like,
Pardon I crave and that my words be deemde
To flow from hearty zeal unto your Grace,
And to the safety of your cōmon weal:
To part your Realm unto my Lords your sōnes
I think not good for you, no yet for them,
But worst of all, for this our Native Land:
For with one Land, one single rule is best:
Divided Reigns do make divided hearts.
But Peace preserves the Country &amp; the Prince.
Such is in man the greedy mind to reign,
So great is his desire to climb aloft,
In worldly Stage the stateliest parts to bear,
That faith and Justice and all kindly love,
Do yield unto desire of Sovereignty:
Where eagle state doth raise an eagle hope
To win the thing that either wold attain
Your grace remembered howe in passed years
The mighty Brute, first Prince of all this Land
Possessed the same and ruled it well in one,
He thinking that the compass did suffice
For his three sons, three kingdoms eke to make
Cut it in three, as you would now in twain:
But how much Brutish blot hath since bē spilt
To join again the sondred unity?
What Princes slain before their timely honour?
What wast of towns and people in the Land?
What Treasons heaped on murders &amp; on spoils?
Whose just revenge even yet is scarcely ceased,
Ruthefull remembrance is yet had in mind:
The Gods forbid the like to chance again
And you (O king) give not the cause thereof:
My Lord Ferrex your elder son, perhaps
Whom kind and custom gives a rightful hope
To be your Heir and to succeed your Reign,
Shall think that he doth suffer greater wrong
Than he perchance will bear, if power serve
Porrex the younger so vnpaised in state,
Perhaps in courage will be raised also,
If Flattery then which sails not to assail▪
The tender minds of yet unskilful Youth,
In one shall kindle and increase disdain:
And Envy in the others heart inflame,
This fire shall waste their love, their lives, their land,
And rutheful ruin shall destroy them both,
A wish not this (O king) so to befall
But fear the thing, that I do most abhor
Give no beginning to so dreadful end,
Keep them in order and obedience:
And let them both by now obeying you,
Learn such behaviour as beseems their state.
The Older, myldenes in his governance,
The younger, a yielding contentedness:
And keep them near unto your presence still,
That they restrained by the awe of you,
May live in compass of well tempered stay,
And pass the perils of their youthful years,
Your aged life draws on to febler time,
Wherein you shall less able be to bear
The travails that in youth you have sustained
Both in your persons and your Realms defence
If planting now your sons in further parts,
You send them further from your present reach
Less shall you know how they thē selves demand
Traitorous corrupters of their pliant youth,
Shall have vnspied a much more free access,
And of ambition and inflamed disdain
Shall arm the one, the other, or them both
To ryuill war, or to usurping pride.
Late shall you rue, that you no recked before:
Good is I grant of all to hope the best,
But not to live still dreadles of the worst,
So trust the one, that the other be forsene,
Arm not unskilfulnes with princely power
But you that lunge have wisely ruled the reigns
Of royalty within your noble Realm
So hold them, while the Gods for our avails
Shall stretch the thread of your prolonged dales
To soon he clāme, into the flaming Carte
Whose want of skill did set the earth on fire,
Time and example of your noble Grace,
Shall teach your sons both to obey and rule▪
When time hath taught thē, time shall make thē pace
The place that now is full: and so I pray
Lunge it remain, to comfort of vs all.
I take your faithful hearts in thankful part
But sith I see no cause to draw my mind,
To fear the nature of my loving sons,
Or to mistime that Envy or disdain,
Can there work hate, where nature plants love
In one self purpose do I still abide,
My love extended egally to both,
My Land suffices for them both also:
Humber shall part the Marches of their Realms:
The Sotherne part the elder shall possess,
The Northern shall Porrex the younger rule,
In quiet I will pass mine aged days,
Free from the travail and the painful cares
That hasten age upon the worthiest kings.
But lest the fraud that ye do seem to fear
Of flattering tongues, corrupt their tender youth
And wrieth them to the ways of youthful lust,
To climbing pride, or to revenging hate
Or to neglecting of their careful charge
Lewdely to live in wanton recklenesse,
Or to oppressing of the rightful cause
Or not to wreak the wrongs done to the poor
To tread down truth, or favour false deceit
I mean to join to either of my sons
Some one of those whose lunge approved faith
And wisdom tried may well assure my heart:
That mining fraud shall find no way to crepee
Into their fenced ears with grave advise:
This is the end, and so I pray you all
To bear my sons the love and loyalty
That I have found within your faithful breasts.
You, nor your sons, our sovereign Lord shall want
Our faith &amp; service while our lives do last.
When settled stay doth hold the royal throne,
In steadfast place by known and doubtless right:
And chiefly when descent on one alone
Make single and vnparted reign to light.
Eche change of course vnioynts the whole estate
And yields it thrall to r•in by debate.
The strength that knit by last accord in one
Against all foreign power of mighty foes,
Could of it self defend it self alone,
Disjoined once, the former force doth lose
The sticks, that sondred brake so soon in twain
In faggot bound attempted were in vain.
Oft tender mind that leads the partial eye
Of erringe parents in their childrens love,
Destroys the wrongful loved child thereby:
This doth the proud son of Appollo prove,
Who rashly set in Chariot of his sire:
Inflamed the perched earth with heavens fire.
And this great king, that doth divide his land,
And changed the course of his descending crown
And yields the reign into his childrens hand
From blissful state of joy and great renown,
A Mirror shall become to Princes all
To learn to shun the cause of such a fall.
I Marvel much what reason lead the king
My father thus without all my desert
To reave me half y• kingdom which by course
Of law and nature should remain to me.
If you with stubborn and untamed pride
Had stood against him in rebellious wise,
Or if with grudging mind you had envied
So slow a sliding of his aged years,
Or sought before your time to haste the course
Of fatal death upon his Royal head,
Or stained your Stock with murder of your kin:
Some face of reason might perhaps have seemed
To yield some likely cause to spoil ye thus.
The wreakful Gods power on my cursed head,
Eternal plagues and never dying woes,
The Hellish Prince, adjudge my dampned ghost
To Tantalus thirst, or proud Ixims wheel
Or cruel Gripe to gnaw my growing heart
To during torments and unquenched flames
If ever I conceived so foul a thought,
To wish his end of life, or yet of reign.
No yet your father (O most noble Prince)
Did ever think so foul a thing of you
For he with more than fathers tender love
While yet the fates do lend him life to rule,
(Who long might live to so your ruling well)
To you my Lord, and to his other son
Lo he resigns his Realm and Royalty
Which never would so wise a Prince have done
If he had ones mistimed that in your heart
There ever lodged so unkind a thought.
But tender love (my Lord) and settled trust
Of your good nature, and your noble mind
Made him to place you thus in Royal throne
And now to give you half his realm to guide
Yea and that half within abounding store
Of things that serve to make a wealthy Realm
In stately Cities and in frutefull soil,
In temperate breathing of the milder heaven,
In things of needful use, which friendly Sea
Transports by traffike from the foreign Ports,
In flowing wealth, in honour and in force,
Doth pass the double value of the part
That Porrex hath allotted to his reign,
Such is your ease, such is your fathers love.
Ah love, my friends, love wrongs not whom he loves.
No yet he wrongs you that gives you
So large a reign ere that the course of time
Bring you to kingdom by descend right,
Which time perhaps might end your time before.
Is this no wrong, say you, to reeve from me
My native right to half so great a realm,
And thus to match his younger son with me
In eagle power, and in as great degree:
Yea &amp; what son? ye son whose swelling pride
Would never yield one point of reverence,
When I the Elder and apparent heir
Stood in the likelyhode to possess the whole
Yea and that son which from his childish age
Envies mine honour, and doth hate my life,
What will he now do? when his pride, his rage,
The mindful malice of his grudging heart
Is armed with force, with wealth and kingly state
Was this not wrong? yea ill advised wrong
To give so mad a man so sharpe a sword,
To so great peril of so great mishap,
Wide open thus to set so large a way.
Alas my Lord, what griefull thing is this?
That of your brother you can think so ill
I never saw him utter likely sign
Whereby a man might see or once mistime
Such hate of you, no such vnyeldinge pride
Ill is their counsel, shameful be their end,
That raising such mistrustful fear in you,
Sowing the seed of such unkindly hate,
Travail by reason to destroy you both:)
Wise is your brother and of noble hope,
Worthy to weld a large and mighty Realm
So much a stronger friend have you thereby,
Whose strēgth is your strēgth, if you gre in one.
If nature and the Gods had pinched so
Their flowing bounty and their noble gifts
Of Princely qualities from you my Lord
And poured them all at ones in wasteful wise
Upon your fathers younger son alone:
Perhaps there be that in your prejudice
Would say that birth should yield to worthiness:
But sith in eche good gift and Princely Act
Ye are his match, and in the chief of all
In mildness and in sobre gouernauce
Ye far surmount: And sith there is in you
Sufficing skill and hopeful towardness
To weld the whole, and match you Elders praise
I see no cause why ye should loose the half,
No wold I wish you yield to such a loss:
Lest your mild sufferance of so great a wrong
Be deemed cowardishe and simple dread:
Which shall give courage to the fiery head
Of your young Brother to invade the whole,
Whiles yet therefore sticks in the peoples mind
The loathed wrong of your disheritaunce,
And ere your Brother have by settled power,
By guile full cloak of an alluring show,
Got him some force and favour in this Realm
And while the noble Queen your mother lives,
To work and practice all for your avail
Attempt redress by Arms, and wreak your self
Upon his life, that gains by your loss,
Who now to shame of you, and grief of vs
In your own kingdom triumphs over you:
Show now your courage meet for kingly estate
That they which have avowed to spēd their goods
Their lands, their lives &amp; honours in your cause,
May be the bolder to maintain your part
Iohan they do see that coward fear in you,
Shall not betraye no sail their faithful hearts.
If ones the death of Porrex end the strife,
And pay the price of his usurped Reign,
Your Mother shall persuade the angry king,
The Lords your friends eke shall appease his rage
For they be wise, and well they can foresee,
That ere lunge time your aged fathers death
will bring a time when you shall well requite
Their friendly favour, or their hateful spite.
Yea, or their slackens to advance your cause
Wise men do not so hang on passing state
Of present Princes, chiefly in their age.
But they will further cast their reaching eye
To view and weigh the times &amp; reigns to come
No is it likely though the king be wroth
That he yet will, or that the Realm will bear
Extreme revenge upon his only son:
Or if he would, what one is he that dare
Be ministry to such an enterprise.
And here you be now placed in your own
Amid your friends, your vassals &amp; your strength
We shall defend and keep your person safe
Till either counsel turn his tender mind
Or age, or sorrow end his weary days
But if the fear of Gods and secrete grudge
Of Natures Law, repining at the fact,
Withhold your courage from so great attempt:
Know ye that lust of kingdoms hath no Law
The Gods do bear and well allow in kings
The things they abhor in rascal routes.
When kings on sclender quarrels ron to wars
And than in cruel and unkindly wise,
Cōmaunde thefts, rapes, murder of Innocents
To spoil of towns, &amp; reigns of mighty realms
Think you such Princes do suppress them selves
Subject to Laws of kind and fear of Gods,
Yet none offence, but decked with glorious name
Of noble Conquests in the hands of kings,
Murders and violent thefts in private men
Are heinous crimes and full of foul reproach:
But if you like not yet so hot devise,
No list to take such vantage of the time.
But though with great peril of your state
You will not be the first that shall invade,
Assemble yet your force for your defence,
And for your safety stand upon your guard.
O heaven was there ever harde or known,
So wicked Counsel to a noble Prince?
Let me (my Lord) disclose unto your grace
This heinous tale, what mischief it contains:
Your fathers death, your brothers and your owns
your present murder and eternal shame:
Hear me (O king) and suffer not to sink
So high a treason in your Princely breast.
The mighty Gods forbid that ever I
Should once conceive such mischief in my heart
Although my Brother hath bereft my Realm
And bear perhaps to me and hateful mind.
Shall I revenge it, with his death therefore?
Or shall I so destroy my fathers life
That gave me life? the Gods forbid I say,
Cease you to speak so any more to me
No you my friend with Answer once repeat
So foul a tale, in silence let in die:
What Lord or Subject shall have hope at all
That under me they safely shall enjoy
Their goods, their honours, lands and liberties,
With whom, neither one only brother dear
No father dearer, could enjoy their lives?
But sith, I fear my younger brothers rage,
And sith perhaps some other man may give
Some like advise, to move his grudging head
At mine estate: which counsel may perchance
Take greater force with him, than this with me,
I will in secrete so prepare my self,
As if his malice or his lust to reign
Break forth with Arms or sudden violence
I may withstand his rage and keep myns own.
I fear the fatal time now draws on
When civil hate shall end the noble lyne
Of famous Brute and of his Royal seed
Great Jove defend the mischiefs now at hand
O that the Secretaries wise advise
Had erst ben harde when he besought the king
Not to divide his land, nor send his sons
To further parts from presence of his Court
No yet to yield to them his governance
Lo such are they now in the Royal throne
As was rash Phaeton in Phebus Carre
No then the fiery stedes did draw the flame
With wilder random through the kindled skies
Then traitorous council now will wherle about
The youthful heads of these unskilful kings,
But I hereof their father will enforeme
The reverence of him perhaps shall staye
The growing mischiefs, while they yet are grene
If this help not, then wo unto them selves,
The Prince, the people, the divided land.
ANd is it thus? And doth he so prepare
Against his Brother as his mortal foe?
And now while yet his aged father lives:
Neither regards be him? nor fears he me?
War would he have? and he shall have it so.
I saw my self the great prepared store
Of Horse, of Armours and of weapons there,
No bring I to my Lord reported tales
Without the ground of seen and searched truth
Lo secrete quarrels run about his Court
To bring the name of you my Lord in hate
Eche man almost can now debate the cause
And ask a reason of so great a wrong,
While he so noble and so wise a Prince,
Is as unworthy rest his Heritage.
And why the king mislead by crafty means
Divided thus his land from course of right.
The wiser sort hold down their griefull heads
Eche man withdraws from talk and company,
Of those that have ben known to favour you,
To hide the mischief of their meaning there.
Rumours are spread of your preparing here.
The Rascal nombres of the unskilful sorts
Are filled with monstrous tales of you and yours
In secrete I was counselled by my friends
To hast me thence, and brought you as you know
Letters from those, that both can truly tell
And would not write unless they knew it well.
My Lord, yet ere you now unkindly war,
Send to your Brother to demand the cause.
Perhaps some traitorous tales have filled his ears
with false reports against your noble grace:
Which once disclosed shall end the growing strife
That else not stayed with wise foresight in time
Shall hazard both your kingdoms &amp; your lives:
Send to your father eke, he shall appeal
Your kindled minds, and rid you of this fear.
Rid me of fear? I fear him not at all:
No will to him, no to my father send
If danger were for one to tarry there
Think ye it safely to return again.
In mischiefs such as Ferrex now intends
The wanted courteous Laws to Messengers
Are not observed, which in just war they use,
Shall I so hazard any one of mine?
Shall I betray my trusty friend to him?
That hath disclosed his treason unto me?
Let him entreat that fears, I fear him not:
Or shall I to the king my father send?
Yea and send now while such a mother lives
That loves my Brother and that hates me?
Shall I give leisure by my fond delays
To Forrex to oppress me at unwary?
I will not, but I will invade his Realm
And seek the Traitor Prince within his Court
Mischief for mischief is a due reward.
His wretched head shall pay the worthy price
Of this his Treason and his hate to me
Shall I abide, entreat and send and pray?
And hold my yelden throat to Traitors knife?
While I with valiant mind &amp; conquering force
Might rid my self of foes: and win a Realm,
Yet rather when I have the wretches head,
Than to the king my father will I send,
The bootless case may yet appease his wrath:
If not I will defend me as I may.
Lo here the end of these two youthful kings
The fathers death, the reign of their two realms
O most unhappy state of Counsellours
That light on so unhappy Lords and times
That neither can their good advise be harde,
Yet must they bear the blames of ill success
But I will to the king their father haste
Ere this mischief come to that likely end,
That if the mindful wrath of wreakful Gods
Since mighty Ilions fall not yet appeased
With these poor remnant of the Troians name
Have not determinedly vnmoued fate
Out of this Realm to rase the Brutish Line
By good advise, by awe of fathers name
By force of wiser Lords, this kindled hate
May yet be quentched, ere it consume vs all.
When youth not bridled with a guiding stay fray,
Is left to random of their own delight
And welds whole Realms, by force of sovereign
Great is the danger of vnmaistred might
Lest skills rage throw down with headlong fall
Their lands, their states, their lives, them selves &amp; all.
When growing pride doth fill the swelling breast
And greedy lust doth raise the climbing mind
Oh hardly may the peril be repressed,
No fear of angry Gods, no Laws kind,
No Country care can fired hearts restrain
When force hath armed Envy and disdain.
When kings of foreset will neglect the rede,
Of best advise, and yield to pleasing tales
That do their fancies noisome humour feed
He reason, nor regard of right avails
Succeeding heaps of plagues shall teach to late
To learn the mischiefs of misguiding state.
Foul fall the Traitor false that undermines
The love of Brethren to destroy them both
Wo to the Prince, that pliant ear inclines,
And yields his mind to poisonous tale, yt flows
From flattering mouth, &amp; wo to wretched land
That wastes it self with civil sword in hand.
Lo, thus it is poison in gold to take,
And wholesome drink in homely Cup forsake.
O Cruel fates, O mindful wrath of Gods▪
whose vēgeaūice neither Simois streined strea∣mes.
Flowing with blood of Trojan Princes slain
Nor Phrygian fields made rank with Corpses dead
Of Asian kings and Lords can yet appease,
He slaughter of unhappy Pryams race
Nor Ilions fall made level with the soil,
Can yet suffice: but still continued rage,
Pursue our lives, and from the farthest Seas
Doth chaste the issues of destroyed Troye:
Oh no man happy, till his end be seen,
If any flowing wealth and seeming Joy
In present yeresmight make a happy wight,
Happy was Hecuba the woefullest wretch
That ever lived to make a Mirror of
And happy Pryam with his noble sons,
And happy I till now, Alas, I see
And feel my most unhappy wretchedness:
Behold my Lords, read ye this Letter here
Lo it contains the ruin of our Realm
If timely speed provide not hastle help
Yet (O ye Gods) if ever woeful king
Might move you kings of kings, wreak it on me
And on my Sons, not on this gilties Realm.
Send down your wasting flames from wrathful skies
To reave me &amp; my sōnes the hateful breath
Read, read my Lords: this is the matter why
I called ye now to have your good advise.
MY Sovereign Lord, what I am loath to write
But lothest am to see, that I am forced
By Letters now to make you understand
My Lord Ferrex your eldest son mislead
By Traitors framed of young vntempred wits
Assembleth force against your younger son,
No can my Counsel yet withdraw the heate
And furious pangs of his inflamed head:
Disoaine (says he) of his inheritance
Arms him to wreak the great pretended wrong
With civil sword upon his Brothers life,
If present help do not restrain this rage
This flame will wast your sōnes, your land &amp; you.
O King, appease your grief &amp; stay your plaint
Great is the matter and a woeful case
But timely knowledge may bring timely help
Send for thē both unto your presence here
The reverence of your honour age and state
Your grave advise, the awe of fathers name
Shall quickly knit again this broken piece:
And if in either of my Lords your sons
Be such untamed and vnyelding pride
As will not bend unto your noble Hestes.
If Ferrex the elder son can bear no peer.
Or Porrex not content, aspires to more
Then you him gave, aboue his Native right:
Join with the juster side, so shall you force
Them to agree: and bold the Land in state.
What means this? Lo yonder cōmes in hast
Philander from my Lord your younger son.
The Gods send joyful news.
The mighty Jove
Preserve your Majesty, O noble king.
Philander, welcome: But how doth my son?
Your son, sir, lives and healthy I him left:
But yet (O king) this want of lustful health
Could not be half so griefefull to your Grace,
As these most wretched tidings that I bring.
O heavens yet more? no end of woes to 〈◊〉?
Tinder, O king, came lately from the Court
Of Ferrex, to my Lord your younger son,
And made report of great prepared store
Of war, and saith that it is whollic meant
Against Porrex for high disdain that he
Lives now a king and eagle in degree
With him, that claims to succeed the whole.
As by due title of discedinge right
Porrex is now so set on flamynge fire,
Partly with kindled rage of cruel wrath,
Partly with hope to gain a Realm thereby,
That he in haste prepares to invade
His Brothers Land, and with unkindly war
Threatens the murder of your elder son,
No could I him persuade that first he should
Send to his Brother to demand the cause,
Nor yet to you to stay his hateful strife.
Wherefore sith there no more I can be harde.
I come my self now to inform your Grace:
And to beseech you, as you love the lief
And safety of your Children and your Realm.
Now to employ your wisdom and your force
To stay this mischief ere it be to late.
Are they in Arms? would he not send for me▪
Is this the honour of a Fathers name?
In vain we travail to assuage their minds
As if their hearts whom neither Brothers love
Nor Fathers awe, nor kingdoms care can move
Our Coūsels could withdraw from raging heat
Jove slay them both, and end the cursed Lyne
For though perhaps fear of such mighty force
As I my Lords, joined with your noble Aides
May yet raise, shall repress their present heate,
The secrete grudge and malice will remain
The fire not quentched, but kept in close restraint
Fead still within, breaks forth with double flame
Their death and mine must peaze the angry gods
Yield not, O king, so much to weak dispaier
Your sons yet live, and long I trust, they shall:
If fates had taken you from earthly life
Before beginning of this civil strife:
Perhaps your sons in their vnmaistered youth,
Lose from regard of any living wight,
Would run on headlong, with unbridled Race
To their own death and ruin of this Realm.
But sith the God that have the care for kings,
Of things and times dispose the order so
That in your life this kindled flame breaks forth
While yet your life, your wisdom &amp; your power,
May stay the growing mischief, and repress
The fiery blaze of their kindled heate
It seems, and so ye ought to deem thereof,
That loving Jove hath tempered so the time
Of this debate to happen in your days
That you yet living may the same appease.
And add it to the glory of your latter age
And they your sons may learn to live in peace
Beware (O king) the greatest harm of all,
Lest by your wayleful plaints your hastened death
Yield larger rome unto their growing rage:
Preserve your life, the only hope of stay:
And if your highness herein list to use
Wisdom or force, Counsel or knightly aide:
Lo we our persons, powers and lives are yours.
Use vs till Death, O king, we are your own.
Lo here the peril that was erst forsene
When you, (O king) did first divide your Land
And yield your present reign unto your sons.
But now (O noble Prince) now is no time
To whale and plain, and wast your woeful life,
Now is the time for present good advise,
Sorrow doth dark the Judgment of the wit
The Hart vnbroken and the courage free
From feeble faintness of bootless dispaier
Doth either rise to safety or renown
By noble valor of vnuanquisshed mind
Or yet doth perish in more happy sort
Your Grace may send to either of your sons
Some one both wise and noble personage,
Which with good counsel &amp; with weighty name
Of father shall present before their eyes
Your hest, your lief, your safety and their own
The present mischief of their deadly strife
And in the while, assemble you the force
Which your Cōmaundement and the speed hast
Of all my Lords here present can prepare:
The terror of your mighty power shall steye
The rage of both, or yet one at lest.
O King the greatest grief that ever Prince did here
The ever woeful Messenger did tell,
That ever wretched Land hath scene before
I bring to you. Porrex your younger son
With soden force, invaded hath the land
That you to Ferrex did allot to rule:
And with his own most bloody hand he hath
His Brother slain, and doth possess his Realm.
O Heauēs send down the flames of your revenge,
Destroy I say with flasshe of wreakful fire
The Traitor son, and than the wretched sire:
But let vs go, that yet perhaps I may
Die with revenge, and peaze the hateful gods.
The lust of kingdoms knows no sacred faith
No rule of Reason, no regard of right
No kindly love, no fear of heavens wrath:
But with contempt of Gods, and mans despite,
Through blodie slaughter doth prepare the ways
To fatal Sceptre and accursed reign.
The son so lothes the fathers lingering days.
No dreads his hand in Brothers blot to stain
O wretched Prince, no doest thou yet record
The yet fresh Murders done within the Land
Of thie forefathers, when the cruel sword
Bereft Morgan his lief with Cousins hand?
Thus fatal plagues pursue the guilty race
Whose murderous hand imbrued with guiltless blood
Asks avenge ounce before the heavens face,
With endless mischiefs on the cursed brood.
The wicked child this brings to woeful Sier
The mournful plaints to wast his weary life:
Thus do the cruel flames of Civil fire
Destroy the parted reign with hateful strife
And hence doth spring the well frō which doth sloe:
The dead black streams of mornings, plaints &amp; woe.
Why sold I live and linger forth my tune
In longer lief to double my distress?
O me most woeful wight whom no mishap
Long ere this day could have bereaved hence.
Mought not these hands by fortune or by fate,
Have perst this breast and life with Iron reft,
Or in this Palace here where I so lunge
Have spent my days, could not that happy hour▪
Ones, ones have hoped I which these huge frames
With death by fall might have oppressed me
Or should not this most hard and cruel soil,
So left where I have pressed my wretched steps
Sometime had ruth of mine accursed lief,
To rend in twain and swallow me therein,
So had my bones possessed now in peace
Their happy grave within the closed ground
And greedy worms had gnawen this pined hart
Without my feelyinge pain: So should not now
This living breast remain the ruthefull tomb
Wherein my hart yelden to death is graved:
Nor dreary thoughts with pangs of pining grief
My doleful mind had not afflicted thus,
O my beloved son: O my sweet child,
My tear Ferrex, my Joy, my lives delight.
Is my well-beloved son, is my sweet child,
My dear Perrex, my Joy, my lives delight
Murdered with cruel death? O hateful wretch,
O heinous Traitor both to heaven and earth,
Thou Porrex, thou this damned dede hast wrought
Thou Porrex, thou shalt dearly aby the same,
Traitor to kin and kind, to Sire and me,
To thine own flesh, and Traitor to thy self
The Gods on the in hell shall wreak their wrath,
And here in earth this hand shall take revenge
On the Porrex, thou false and caitiff wight,
If after blot, so eigre were thy thirst
And Murderous mind had so possessed thee,
If such hard hart of Rock and stony Flint
Lived in thy breast, that nothing else could like
Thy cruel Tyrants thought but death &amp; blood
Wild savage beasts mought not y• slaughter serve
To fed thy greedy will, and in the midst
Of their entrails to stain thy deadly hands
With blot deserved, and drink thereof thy fill:
Or if nought else but death and blood of man
Mought please thy lust, could none in Britain land
Whose hart be torn out of his loving breast
With thine own hand, or work what death thou would
Suffice to make a Sacrifice to appease would
That deadly mind &amp; murderous thought in the?
But he who in the self same womb was wrapped
Where thou in dismal hour received life?
Or if needs, needs thy• hand must slaughter make
Moughist thou not have reached a mortal wound
And with thy sword have persed this cursed womb?
That the accursed Porrex brought to light?
And given me a just reward therefore.
So Ferrex, if sweet life mought have enjoyed
And to his aged father comfort brought,
with some young son in whom they both might live
But whereunto wast I this ruthefull speech?
To the that hast thy brothers blood thus shed
Shall I still think yt from this womb thou sprung?
That I thee bare? or take thee for my son?
No Traitor, no: I the refuse for mine,
Murderer I thee renounce, thou art not mine:
Never, O wretch, this womb conceived thee,
Nor never bode I painful throws for thee:
Changeling to me thou art, and not my child
Nor to no wight, that spark of pity knew,
Rutheles, unkind, Monster of Natures work.
Thou never sucked the milk of women's breast
But from thy birth the cruel Tigress teates
Have nursed, nor yet of flesh and blood
Formed is thy hart, but of hard Iron wrought.
And wilde and desert woods bread thee to life:
But can thou hope to scope my just revenge?
Or that these hands will not be wrooke on thee?
Doest thou not know that Ferrex mother lives
That loved him more dearly then her self?
And doth she live, and is not venged on thee?
WE marvel much where this lingering stay
Falls out so lunge: Porrex unto our Court
By order of our Letters is returned
And Eubulus received from vs by hest
At his arrival here to give him charge
Before our presence straight to make repair
And yet we have no word whereof he stays.
Lo where he cōmes and Eubulus with him.
According to your highness hest to me
Here have I Porrex brought even in such sort
As from his wearied Horse he did alight,
For that your Grace did will such haste therein.
We like and praise this speed will in you
To work the thing that to your charge we gave
Porrex, if we so far should swerve from kind,
And frō these bounds which laws of Nature sets
As thou hast done by vile and wretched deed
In cruel murder of thy Brothers life,
Our present hand could stay no longer time,
But straight should bathe this blade in blood of the
As just revenge of thy detested crime.
No. we should not offend the law of kind,
If now this sword of ours did slay thee here:
For thou hast murdered him whose heinous death
Even Natures force doth move vs to revenge
By blood again: But Justice forces vs
To measure Death for Death, thy due desert,
Yet since thou art our child, and sith as yet
In this harde case what word thou can allege
For thy defence, by vs hath not ben harde
We are content to stay our will for that
Which Justice bids vs presently to work:
And give the leave to use thie speech at full
If ought thou have to lay for thine excuse.
Neither O king, I can or will deny
But that this hand from Ferrex life hath reft:
Which fact how much my doleful hart doth wail
Oh would it mought as full appear to sight
As inward grief doth power it forth to me,
So yet perhaps if ever ruthefull hart
Melting in tears within a manly breast
Through deep repentance of his bloody fact
If ever grief, if ever woeful man
Might move regreite with sorrow of his fault,
I think the torment of my mournful case
Known to your grace, as I do feel the same,
Would force even wrath her self to pity me.
But as the water troubled with the mud
Shows not the face which else the eye should see,
Even so your Ireful mind with stirred thought,
Can not so perfectly discern my cause.
But this unhappy, amongst so many heaps
I must content me with, most wretched man,
That to my self I must refer my woe
In pining thoughts of mine accursed fact:
Since I may not show here my smallest grief
Such as it is, and as my breast endures,
Which I esteem the greatest misery
Of all mishaps that Fortune now can send.
Not that I rest in hope with plaints and tears
Should purchase life: for to the Gods I clepe
For true record of this my faithful speech,
Never this heart shall have the thoughtful dread
To die the death that by your Graces dome
By just desert, shall be pronounced to me:
Nor never shall this tongue ones spend this speech
Pardon to crave, or seek by suit to live:
I mean not this as though I were not touched
With care of dreadful death, or that I held
Life in contempt: but that I know, the mind
Stoups to no dread, although the flesh be frail,
And for my gilt, I yield the same so great
As in my self I find a fear to sue
For grant of life.
In vain, O wretch thou show•
A woeful heart, Ferrex now lies in grave,
Slain by thy hand.
Yet this, O father, hear;
And than I end: Your Majesty well knows,
That when my Brother Ferrex and my self
By your own hest were joined in governance
Of this your Graces Realm of Britain Land
I never sought nor travailed for the same,
Nor by my self, or by no scent I wrought▪
But from your highness will alone it sprung,
Of your most gracious goodness bent to me,
But howe my Brothers hart even than re•med
With swollen disdain against mine egali rule
Seeing that Realm, which by descent should grow
Wholly to him, allotted half to me?
Even in your highness Court he now remains,
And with my Brother than in nearest place
Who can record, what proof thereof was shewde
And how my brothers envious hart appeared
Yet I that judged it my part to seek
His favour and good will, and loathe to make
Your highness know, the thing which should have brought
Grief to your grace, &amp; your offēce to him
Hoping by earnest suite should soon have won
A loving hart within a Brothers breast
Wrought in that sort that for a pledge of love
And faithful hart, he gave to me his hand.
This made me think, that he had banished quite
All rancour from his thought and bare to me
Such hearty love, as I did owe to him:
But after once we left your Graces Court
And from your highness presence lived apart
This eagle rule still, still did grudge him so
That now those Envious sparks which erst lay raked
In living cinders of dissembling breast,
Kindled so far within his hates disdain
That longer could he not refrain from proof
Of secrete practise to deprive me life
By Poisons force, and had bereft me so.
If mine own Servant hired to this fact
And moved by truth with hate to work the same,
In time had not betrayed it unto me:
When thus I saw the knot of love vnknitte
All honest League and faithful promise broke
The Law of kind and troth thus rent in twain
His hart on mischief set, and in his breast
Black treason hid then, then did I dispaier
That ever time could win him friend to me
Than saw I howe he smiled with slaying knife
Wrapped under cloak, then saw I deep deceit
Lurk in his face and death prepared for me:
Even nature moved me than to hold my life
More dear to me than his, and bad this hand
Since by his life my death must needs ensue,
And by his death my life to be preserved:
To shed his blood, and seek my safety so.
And wisdom willed me without protract
In speed wise to put the same in ur.
Thus have I told the cause that moved me
To work my Brothers death and so I yield
My life, my death to judgment of your grace.
Oh cruel wight, should any cause prevail
To make the stain thy hands with brothers blot
But what of thee we will resolve to doe
Shall yet remain unknown: Thou in the mean
Shalt from our royal presence banished be
Until our Princely pleasure further shall
To the be showed, depart therefore our sight
Accursed child. What cruel destiny
What froward fate hath sorted vs this chance
That even in those, where we should comfort find
Where our delight now in our aged days
Should rest and be, even there our only grief
And depest sorrows to abridge our lief,
Most pining cares and deadly thoughts do grave yours
Your Grace should now in these grave years of
Have found ere this the price of mortal Joys,
Howe short they be, howe fading hear in earth
Howe full of change, howe Brittle our estate,
Of nothing sure, save only of the Death,
To whom both man and all the world doth owe
Their end at last, neither shall natures power
In other sort against your heart prevail,
Than as the naked hand whose stroke assays
The Armed breast where force doth light in vain
Many can yield right grave and sage advise
Of patient sprite to others wrapped in woe,
And can in speech both rule and conquer kind,
Who if by proof, they might feel natures force,
Wold show them selves men as they are in dede,
which now will needs be gods: but what doth me∣an
The sorry chere of her that here doth come?
Oh where is ruth? or where is pity now?
Whether is gentle heart and mercy fled?
Are they exiled out of our stony breasts
Never to make return? is all the world
Drowned in blood, and sunk in cruelty?
If not in women mercy may be found
If not (alas) within the mothers breast
To her own child, to her own flesh and blood
If ruth be banished thence, if pity there
May have no place, if there no gentle heart
Do live and dwell, where should we seek it than?
Madame (alas) what means your woeful tale?
O silly woman I, why to this hour,
Have kind and fortune thus deferred my breathe
That I should live to see this doleful day
Will ever wight believe that such harde heart
Could rest within the cruel mothers breast,
With her own hand to slay her only son?
But out (alas) these eyes beheld the same,
They saw the dreary sight, and are become
Most ruthful records of the bloody fact.
Porrex, (alas) is by his mother slain,
And with her hand a woeful thing to tell,
While slomberinge on his careful bed he rests
His hart stalde in with kniefe is reft of life.
O Eubulus, oh draw this sword of ours,
And pierce this hart with speed, O hateful light,
O loathsome lief, O sweet and welcome Death,
Dere Eubulus work this we thee beseech.
Patient your Grace, perhaps he lives yet.
With wound received, but not of certain death.
O let vs than repaier, unto the place,
And see if that Porrex, or thus be slame.
Alas he lives not, it is to true,
That with these eyes of him a pereles Prince,
Son to a King, and in the flower of youth,
Even with a twinke a censeles stock I saw.
O dampned deed.
But hear this ruthefull end.
The noble Prince perst with the sudden wound
Out of his wretched slombre hastily start
Whole strēgth now failing straight he overthrew
When in the fall his eyes even new unclosed
Beheld the Queen and cried to her for help
We then, alas, the Ladies which that time
Did there attend, saying that heinous deed
And hearing him oft call the wretched name
Of mother, and to cry to her for Aide
Whose direful hand gave him the mortal wound
Pitieng, (alas, for nought else could we do)
His ruthefull end, ran to the woeful bed
Despoiled straight his breast, and all we might
wiped in vain with napkins next at hand,
The sudden streams of blood that flushed fast
Out of the gaping wound: O what a look,
O what a ruthefull steadfast eye me thought
He fixed upon my face, which to my death
Will never part fro me, when with a braid
Adeepe set sign he gave and therewith all
Clasping his hands, to heaven he cast his sight▪
And straight pale death pressing within his face
The flying ghost his mortal corps forsook.
Never did age bring forth so vile a fact.
O harde and cruel hap, that thus assigned
Unto so worthy a wight so wretched end
But most harde cruel heart, that could consent
To lend the hatefnll destinies that hand
By which, alas, so heinous crime was wrought,
O Queen of Adamant, O Marble breast
If not the favour of his comely face,
If not his Princely chere and counten•uncle,
His valiant Active Arms, his manly breast.
If not his fair and semelie personage
His noble Limbs in such preparation caste
As would have wrapped a silly women's thought
If this mought not have moved the bloody heart
And that most cruel hand the wretched weapon
Even to let fall, and kissed him in the face,
With tears for ruth to reeve such one by death
Should nature yet consent to slay her son
O mother, thou to murder thus thie child
Even Jove with Justice must with lightening flames
From heaven send down some strange revenge on thee.
Ah noble Prince, how oft have I beheld
Thee mounted on thy fierce and trampling stead
Shining in Armour bright before the Tilt
And with thy Mistress Sleaue tied on thy Helm
And charge thy staff to please thy Ladies eye
That hoved the head piece of thy friendly foe,
Howe oft in Arms on horse to bend the Mace
Howe oft in Arms on foot to break the sword,
Which never now these eyes men 〈◊〉 again.
Madame, alas, in vain these plaints are shed.
Rather with me depart and help to assuage,
The thoughtful griefs that in the aged kings
Must needs by nature grow by death of this
His only son, whom he did hold so dear.
What wight is that which saw that I did see
And could refrain to wail with plaint &amp; tears
Not I, alas, that heart is not in me,
But let vs go, for I am grieved anew,
To call to mind the wretched fathers woe.
When greedy lust in Royal seat to reign
Hath reft all care of gods and eke of men,
And cruel hart, wrath, Treason and disdain
Within the ambitious breast are lodged then
Behold howe mischief wide her self displays
And with the brothers hand the brother slaies.
When blood thus shed, doth stain this heavens face
Crying to Jove for vengeance of the deed,
The mighty God even moves from his place
With wrath to wreak, then sends he forth with speed
The dreadful furies, daughters of ye night
With Serpents girt, carrying the whip of Ire,
With hear of stinging snakes and shining bright
With flames and blood, and with a brand of fire:
These for revenge of wretched Murder done
Do make the Mother kill her only son.
Blood asks blood, &amp; death must death requite
Jove by his just and everlasting dome
Justly hath ever so requited it
These times before record, and times to come,
Shall find it true, and so doth present proof,
Present before our eyes for our behoof.
O happy wight that suffres not the snare
Of murderous mind to tangle him in blood▪
And happy he that can in time beware
By others harms and turn it to his good
But wo to him that fearing not to offend
Doth serve his lust, and will not see the end.
DId ever age bring forth such Tyrants hearts
The Brother hath bereft the Brothers life,
The Mother she hath died her cruel hands
In blood of her own son, and now at last
The people lo forgetting truth and love,
Contemning quite both Law and loyal heart
Even they have slain their sovereign Lord and Queen.
Shall this their traitorous crime unpunished rest
Even yet they cease not, carried out with rage,
In their rebellious routes, to threaten still
A new blood shed unto the Princes kin
To slay them all, and to vproote the race
Both of the king and Queen, so are they moved
With Porrex death, wherein they falsely charge
The guiltless king without desert at all
And traitorously have murdered him therefore,
And eke the Queen.
Shall Subjects dare with force
To work revenge upon their Princes fact?
Admit the worst that may: as sure in this
The dede was foul, the Queen to slay her son
Shall yet the Subject seek to take the sword?
Arise against his Lord, and slay his king?
O wretched state, where those rebellious hearts
Are not rent out even from their living breasts
And with the body thrown unto the Fowls
As Carrion food, for terror of the rest.
There can no punishment be thought to great
For this so grievous crime: let speed therefore
Be used therein for it behooves so.
Ye all my Lords I see consent in one
And I as one consent with ye in all:
I hold it more than need with the sharpest Law
To punish the tumultuous bloody rage
For nothing more may shake the cōmen state
Than sufferance of Uproars without redress
Whereby how some kingdoms of mighty power
After great Conquests made, and floorishing
In fame and wealth have ben to ruin brought
I pray to Jove that we may rather whale
Such hap in them than witness in our selves
Eke fully with the Duke my mind agrees
That no cause serves, whereby the Subject may
Call to account the doings of his Prince.
Much less in blood by sword to work revenge
No more then may the hand cut of the head,
In Act nor speech, no: not in secrete thought
The Subject may rebel against his Lord
Or Judge of him that sits in Ceasars Seat.
With grudging mind do damn those Hemislikes
Though kings forget to govern as they ought,
Yet Subjects must obey as they are bound:
But now my Lords before ye farther wade
Or spend your speech, what sharp revenge shall fall
By justice plague on these rebellious wights
Me thinks ye rather should first search the way
By which in time the rage of this uproar
Mought be repressed, &amp; these great tumults ceased
Even yet the life of Britain Land doth hang.
In Traitors Balance of vnegall weight
Think not my Lords the death of Gorboduc
Nor yet Videnaes blood will cease their rage:
Even our own lives, our wives and children,
Our Country dearest of all in danger stands,
Now to be spoiled, now, now made desolate,
And by our selves a conquest too ensue:
For give ones sweye unto the peoples lusts,
To rush forth on, and staye them not in time,
And as the stream that rolled down the hill,
So will they headlong run with raging thoughts
From blood to blood, from mischief unto more,
To ruin of the Realm, them selves and all
So giddle are the cōmon peoples minds,
So glad of change, more wavering than the Sea
Ye see (my Lords) what strength these Rebels have,
What huge nombre is assembled still,
For though the traitorous fact, for which their rose
Be wrought and done, yet lodge they still in field
So that howe far their furies yet will stretch
Great cause we have to dread, that we may seek
By present Battle to repress their power.
Speed must we use to levy force therefore,
For either they forthwith will mischief work
Or their rebellious roars forthwith will cease:
These violent things may have no lasting loud
Let vs therefore use this for present help
Persuade by gentle speech, and offer grace
With gift of pardon save unto the chief,
And that upon condition that forthewith
They yield the Captains of their enterprise
To bear such querdon of their traitorous fact
As may be both due vengeance to them selves,
And wholesome terror to posterity.
This shall I think: flatter the greatest part
That now are holden with desire of home,
Wearied in field with could of Winters nights,
And some (no doubt) stricken with dread of Law
When this is ones proclaimed, it shall make
The Captains to mistrust the multitude
Whose safety bids them to betraye their heads
And so much more because the rascal routes,
In things of great and perilous attempts,
Are never trusty to the noble race.
And while we treat &amp; scande on terms of grace,
We shall both stay their furies rage the while,
And eke gain time, whose only help suffices
Withouten war to vanquish Rebels power
In the mean while, make you in readiness
Such band of Horsemen as ye may prepare:
Horsemen (you know) are not the Commons strēgth
But are the force and store of noble men
Whereby the vnchosen and unarmed sort
Of sk•••she Rebels, whom none other power
But nombre makes to be of dreadful force
With sudden brunt may quickly be oppressed
And if this gentle mean of proffered grace
With stubborn hearts cannot so far avail
As to assuage their desperate courages.
Than do I wish such slaughter to be made,
As present age and eke posterity
May be adrad with horror of revenge,
That justly than shall on these rebels fall:
This is my Lords the sōme of mine advise.
Neither this case admits debate at large,
And though it did: this speech that hath ben said
Hath well abridged the tale I would have told:
Fully with Eubulus do I consent
In all that he hath said: and if the same
To you my Lords, may seem for best advise,
I wish that it should straight be put in ur.
My Lords than let vs presently depart
And follow this that likes vs so well.
If ever time to gain a kingdom here
Were offred man, now it is offred me:
The Realm is reft both of their king &amp; Queen
The offspring of the Prince is slain and dead
No issue now remains, the Heir unknown,
The people are in Arms and mutinies
The Nobles they are busied howe to cease
These great rebellious tumults and uproars
And Britain Land now desert left alone
Amid these broils uncertain where to rest
Offers her self unto that noble heart
That will or dare pursue to bear her Crown:
Shall I that am the Duke of Albany
Descend from that Lyne of noble blood.
Which hath so lunge floorisshed in worthy fame
Of valiant hearts, such as in noble Breasts
Of right should rest aboue the baser sort,
Refuse to adventure lief to win a Crown,
Whom shall I find enemies that will wtstande
My fact herein, if I attempt by Arms
To seek the Fame now in these times of broil
These Dukes power can hardly well appease
The people that already are in Arms.
But if perhaps my force be ones in field
Is not my strength in power aboue the best
Of all these Lords now left in Britain Land.
And though they should match me with power of men
Yet doubtful is the chance of Battles joined
If Victors of the field we may depart,
Ours is the Sceptre than of great Britain,
If slain amid the plain this body be
Mine enemies yet shall not deny me this,
But that I died giving the noble charge
To hazard life for conquest of a Crown.
Forthwith therefore will I in post depart
To Albany and raise in Armour there
All power I can: and here my secrete friends,
By secrete practise shall solicit still,
To seek to win to me the peoples hearts.
O Jove, Howe are these peoples hearts abused
what blind Fury, thus headlong caries thē?
That though so many books, so many rolls
Of Ancient time record what grievous plagues,
Light on these Rebels aye and though so oft
Their ears have hard their aged fathers tell
What just reward these Traitors still receive.
Yea though them selves have scene deep death and blot
By strangling cord &amp; slaughter of the sword
To such assigned, yet can they not beware:
Yet can they not stay their rebellious hands,
But suffering to foul treason to distain
Their wretched minds, forget their loyal heart,
Reject all truth and rise against their Prince,
A ruthefull case that those, whom duties bound
Whom grafted Law by nature truth and faith
Bound to preserve their Coūtrey and their king
Borne to defend their Cōmon wealth &amp; Prince,
Even they should give consent thus to subvert
The Britain Land, &amp; from the wombeshuld bring
(O native soil) those, that will needs destroy
And ruin thee and eke them selves in fine:
For lo, when ones the Duke had offred Grace
Of pardon sweet (the multitude mislead
By traitorous fraud of their ungracious heads)
One sort that saw the dangerous success
Of stubborn standing in rebellious war
And knew the difference of Princes power
From headles nombre of tumultuous routes,
Whom cōmen Countries care and private fear
Taught to repent the terror of their rage
Laid hands upon the Capatines of their band,
And brought them bound unto the mighty Dukes
An other sort not trusting yet so well
The truth of Pardon or mistrusting more
Their own offence than that they could conceive
Such hope of pardon for so foul misdeed:
Or for that they their Captains could not yield
Who fearing to be yielded, flayed before,
Stale home by silence of the secrete night,
The third unhappy and vnraged sort
Of desperate harts, who stained in Princes blood
From traitorous furor could not be withdrawn
By love, by law, by grace, no yet by fear,
By proffered life, no yet by threatened Death,
With minds hopeless of lief, dreadles of Death,
Careless of Country, and aweless of God:
Stood bent to fight as Furies did them move
With violent death to close their traitorous life:
These all by power of Horsemen were oppressed
And with revenging sword slain in the field,
Or with the strangling Cord hanged on the trees
Where yet the carrion Carcases do proche
The fruits that Rebels reap of their uproars,
And of the murder of their sacred Prince,
But lo, where do approach the noble Dukes,
By whom these tumults have ben thus appeasde.
I think the world will now at length beware▪
And fear to put on arms against their Prince.
If not: those traitorous hearts that dare rebel
Let them behold the wide and huge fields
With blood &amp; body spread with rebels slain,
The lusty trees clothed with corpses dead
That strangled with the corde do hang therein.
A just reward such as all times before
Have ever lotted to those wretched folks.
But what means he that cōmeth here so fast.
My Lords, as duty and my troth doth move
And of my Country work and care in me
That if the spending of my breath avail
To do the Service that my heart desires,
I would not shun to embrace a present death,
So have I now in that wherein I thought
My travail mought perform some good effect•
Ventured my lief to bring these tidings here.
Fergus the mighty Duke of Albany
Is now in Arms and lodges in the field
With twenty thousand men, hither he bends
His speed marcke, &amp; minds to invade the Crown
Daily he gathered strength and spreads abroad
That to this Realm no certain Heir remains,
That Britain Land is left without a guide,
That he the Sceptre seeks, for nothing else
But to preserve the people and the Land
Which now remain as ship without a Sterne
Lo this is that which I have hereto said.
Is this his faith? and shall he falsely thus
Abuse the vantage of unhappy times?
O wretched Land, if his outrageous pride,
His cruel and vntempred wilfulness
His deep dissembling shows of false pretence
Should once attain the Crown of Britain land
Let vs my Lords, with timely force resist
The new attempt of this our cōmon foe
As we would quench the flames of cōmen fire.
Though we remain without a certain Prince
To weld the Realm or guide the wandering rule
Yet now the cōmen Mother of vs all,
Our Native Land, our Country that contains
Our wives, children, kindred, our selves and all
That ever is or may be dear to man
Cries unto vs to help our selves and her:
Let vs advance our powers to repress
This growing foe of all our liberties.
Yea let vs so my Lords with hasty speed,
And ye (O Gods) send vs the welcome death,
To shed our blood in field and leave vs not,
In loathe some life to longer out our lives
To see the huge heaps of these vnhappes,
That now roll down upon the wretched Land
Where empty place of Princely governance
No certain stay now left of doubtless heir,
Thus leave this guidelesse Realm an open pray,
To endless storms and wast of civil war.
That ye (my Lords) do so agree in one
To save your Country from the violent reign
And wrongfully usurped Tyranny
O• him that threatens conquest of you all
To save your realm, &amp; in this realm your selves
From foreign thraldom of so proud a Prince,
Much do I praise, and I beseech the Gods,
With happy honour to requite it you.
But (O my Lords) sith now the Heavens wrath
Hath reft this Land the issue of their Prince:
Sith of the body of our late Sovereign Lord
Remains no mo, since the young kings be slain
And of the Title of the descend Crown,
Uncertainly the diverse minds do think
Even of the Learned sort, and more uncertainly
Will partial fancy and affection deem:
But most vncertenlye will climbing pride
And hope of Reign withdraw frō sundry parts
The doubtful right and hopeful lust to reign.
When ones this noble service is achieved
For Britain Land the Mother of ye all,
When ones ye have with armed force repressed,
The proud attempts of this Albanyan Prince,
That threatens thraldom to your Native Land,
When ye shall vanquishers return from field
And find the Princely state an open pray.
To greedy lust and to usurping power,
Then, then (my Lords) if ever kindly care
Of ancient Honour of your ancestors,
Of present wealth and nobles of your stocks:
Yea of the lives and safety yet to come
Of your dear wives, your children &amp; your selves,
Might move your noble hactes with gentle ruth,
Then, then have pity on the torn estate,
Then help to salve the well near hopeless sore
Which ye shall do, if ye your selves with hold
The sleayng knife from your own mothers throat
Her shall you save, and you, and yours in her
If ye shall all with one assent forbear
Ones to lay hand or take unto your selves
The Crown by colour of •••tended right,
Or by what other means so ever it be
Till first by cōmen counsel of you all
In Parliament the Regal Diadem
Be set in certain place of governance,
In which your Parliament and in your choice,
Preserve the right (my Lords,) without respect
Of strenght of friends, or what so ever cause
That may set forward any others part,
For right will last, and wrong can not endure,
Right mean I his or hers, upon whose name
The people rest by mean of Native lyne,
Or by the virtue of some former Law,
Already made their title to advance:
Such one (my Lords) let be your chosen king
Such one so borne within your Native Land
Such one prefer, and in no wise adinitte.
The heavy yoke of foreign governance,
Let foreign Titles yield to Public wealth,
And with that hart wherewith ye now prepare
Thus to withstand the proud inuadynge foe,
With that same heart (my Lords) keep out also
Unnatural thraldom of strangers reign,
No suffer you against the rules of kind
Your Mother Land to serve a Foreign Prince.
¶Lo here the end of Brutus royal Lyne,
And lo the entry to the woeful wrack
And utter ruin of this noble Realm.
The royal king, and eke his sons are slain,
No Ruler rests within the Regal Seat:
The Heir, to whō the Sceptre longs, unknown
That to eche force of Foreign Princes power
Whom vantage of your wretched state
By sudden Arms to gain so rich a Realm
And to the proud and greedy mind at home
Whom blinded lust to reign leads to aspire.
Lo Brittaiue Realm is left an open pray,
A present spoil by Conquest to ensue,
Who sees not now howe many rising minds
Do feed their thoughts, with hope to reach a Realm
And who will not by force attempt to win
So great a gain that hope persuades to have:
A simple colour shall for title serve.
Who wins the Royal crown will want no right
Nor such as shall display by lunge descent
A lineal race to prove him self a king,
In the mean while these civil arms shall rage,
And thus a thousand mischiefs shall unfold
And far &amp; near spread thee (O Britain Land)
All right and Law shall cease, and he that had
Nothing to day, to morrow shall enjoy
Great heaps of good, &amp; he that flowed in wealth,
Leo he shall be reft of life and all,
And happiest he that than possesses least.
The wives shall suffer rape, the maids deflowered
And children fatherless shall weep and whale:
With fire &amp; sword thy Native folk shall perisshe.
One kinsman shall bereave an other life,
The father shall unwitting slay the son,
The son shall slay the sire and know it not:
Women and maids the cruel Soldiers sword
Shall perse to death, and silly children lo
That playing in the strea•es &amp; fields are found
By violent hand shall close their latter day.
Whom shall the ferce and bloody Soldier
Reserve to lief, whom shall he space from death
Even thou (O wretched mother) half alive
Thou shalt behold thy dear and only child
Slain with the sword while he yet sucks thy breast:
Lo, guiltless blood shall thus eche where be shed:
Thus shall the wasted soil yield forth no fruit
But derth and famine shall possess the Land.
The Towns shall be consumed &amp; brent with fire,
The peopled Cities shall ware desolate,
And thou (O Britain Land) meanwhile in renown
Meanwhile in wealth and fame shalt thus be torn,
Dismembered thus, and thus be rent in twain,
Thus wasted and defaced, spoiled and destroyed:
These be the fruits your civil wars will bring.
Heretost cōmes when kings will not consent,
To grave advise, but follow wilful will:
This is the end, when in young Princes hearts
Flattery prevails, and sage rede hath no place:
These are the plages, when murder is the mean
To make new Heirs unto the Royal Crown.
Thus wreak the Gods, whē ye the mothers wrath
Nought but y• blood of her own child may swag.
These mischiefs springs whē Rebels will arise,
To work revenge and judge their Princes fact:
This, this ensues when noble men do fail
In loyal truth, and subjects will be kings.
And this doth grow when lo unto the Prince,
Whom death or sodene hap of lief bereaves,
No certain Heir remains, such certentie
As not all only is the rightful Heir,
But to the Realm is so made unknown to be
And troth thereby vested in Subjects hearts,
To owe faith there, where right is known to rest
Alas, in Parliament what hope can bee,
When is of Parliament no hope at all,
Which though it be assembled by consent,
Yet is it not likely with consent to end:
While eche one for him self, or for his friend
Against his foe, shall travail what he may,
While now the state left open to the man,
That shall with greatest force invade the same,
Shall fill ambitious minds with gaping hope:
When will they ones with yielding harts agree?
Or in the while, howe shall the Realm he used?
No, no: then Parliament should have ben holden
And certain Heirs appointed to the Crown
To stay their title of established right:
And plant the people in obedience
While yet the Prince did live, whose name and power
By lawful Sōmons and auctorytie
Might make a Parliament to be of force,
And might have set the state in quiet staye:
But now (O happy man) whom speed death
Deprives of life, no is enforced to see
These huge mischiefs and these miseries,
These civil wars, these murders &amp; these wrongs
Of Justice, yet must Jove in fine restore
This noble Crown unto the lawful Heir:
For right will always live, and rise at length,
But wrong can never take deep root to last.
