
IEsu that his arms did sprede
And on a tree was done to dead
From all perils he you defend
I desire audience till I have made an end
For am come from God aboue
To occupy his laws to your behove
And am named Charity
There may no man saved be
without the help of me
For he that Charity doth refuse
Other virtues thought he do use
••e•out charity it will ••t •e
For it is written in the faith
Queen mane• in charitate in deo monet
I am the gate I tell the
Of heaven that joyful city
There may no make thither come
But of charity he must have some
Or ye may not come iwis
Unto heaven the city of bliss
Therefore charity who will him take
A pure soul it will him make
Before the face of God
In the .A.B.C. of books the least
yt is written deus charitas est
Lo charity is a great thing
Of all virtues it is the king
When God in earth was here living
Of charity he found none ending
I was planted in his hart
We two might not depart
Out of his heart I did spring
Through the might of the heaven king
And all prestos that be
May singe no mass without charity
And chary to them they do not take
They may not receive him that did them make
And all this world of nought
¶A back fellows and give me rome
Or I shall make you to avoid soon
I am goodly of person
I am pereles where ever I come
My name is youth I tell the
I flourish as the vine tree
who may belikeneth unto me
In my youth and Jollity
My heart is royal and bushed thick
My body pliant as a hazel stick
Mine arms be both fair and strong
My fingers be both fair and lunge
My chest big as a tun
My legs be full light for to run
To hop and dance and make merry
By the mass I reck not a cheri
What so ever I do
I am the heir of my fathers land
And it is come into my hand
I care for nomore
¶Are you so disposed to doo
To follow vice and set virtue go
Ye sir even so
For now a days he is not set by
Without he be unthrifty
You had need to ask God mercy
Why do you so prase your body
Why knave what is that to the
will thou let me to praise my body
why should I not praise it &amp; it be goodly
I will not let for the
What shall it be when thou shalt flyt
For the wealth into the pyt
Therefore of it be not to boolde
Least thou forthink it when thou art old
ye may be likened to a tree
In youth flourishing with royalty
And in age it is cut down
And to the fire is thrown
So shalt thou but thou amend
Be burned in hell without end

Be ware least thou thither go
Hence caitiff go thy way
Or with my dagger I shall the slay
Hens knave out of this place
Or I shall lay the on the face
Say thou that I shall go to hell
For ever more there to dwell

¶A yet sir do by my rede
And ask mercy for thy misdeed
And you shalt be an herytoure of bliss
Where al joy and mirth is
Where thou shall se a gloryus sight
Of aūgeles singing with saints bright
Before the face of God
¶What sirs abowe the sky
I ho need of a ladder to climb so hie
But what and the ladder slyppe
Than I am deceived yet
And if I fall I catch a quecke
I may fortune to break my neck
And that joint is ill to set
Nay nay not so
¶O yet remember cal to thy mind
The mercy of God passes al thing
For it is written by noble clerks

Miseratio domini super omnia opera eius

Nether by day no be night
Therefore do my counsel I say
Than to heaven thou shalt have thy way
¶No sir I think ye will not fight
But to take a man purse in the night

For such holy caitiffs
Were wont to be thieves
And such would be hanged as hye
As a man may se with his eye
In faith this same is true
¶God save every christen body
From such euell destiny
And send vs of his grace

And talk to me of no goodness
And soon loke thou go thy way
Lest with my dagger I the slay
In faith if thou mene my heart
Thou shalt be weary of thy part
Or thou and I have done
¶Think what God suffered for the
His arms to be spread upon a tree
A knight with a spear opened his side
In his heart appeared a wound wide
That bought both you and me
¶Gods fast what is that to me
Thou dawe will thou rede me
In my youth to lose my ioylytie
Hence knave and go thy way
Or with my dagger I shall the slay
¶ O sir hear what I you tell,
And be ruled after my counsel
That ye might sit in heaven hye

And amend that thou hast mys wrought
That thou moist save that God hath bought
¶What say ye master charity
whath hath God bought
By my troth I know not
〈1 line〉
He came never at the stues
Nor in no place where I do use
I wis he bought not my cap
Nor yet my ioylie hat
I wot not what he hath bought for me
And he bought any thing of mine
I will g•ue him a quart of wine
The next time I him meet
¶Sir this he did for the
When thou wast honda he made the free
And bought the with his blood
¶Sir I pray you tell me
Howe may this be
That I know I was never bond
Unto none in England
¶Sir I shall tell you
When Adam had done great trespass
And out of paradise exiled was
Then all the soles as I can you tell
were in the bondage of the devil of hell
Till the father of heaven of his great mercy
Sent the second person in Trinity
Us for to redeem
And so with his precious blood
He bought vs on the rood
And our souls did save
¶Howe should I save it tell me now
and I will be ruled after you my soul to sau•

Youth will thou do so
Follow them and let vs go
Mary I trow nay
¶Here all sin I forsake
And to God I me betake
Good Lord I pray the have no indignation
That I a sinner should ask salvation
¶Now thou must forsake pride
And all Riot set aside
¶I will not him forsake
Neither early no late
I wend he would not forsake me
But if it will none otherwise bee
I will go my way
¶Sir I pray God be your speed
and help your at your need
¶I am sure thou wilt not forsake me
Nor I will not forsake thee
¶I forsake you also
and will not have with you to do
¶And I forsake the utterly
Fie on the caitiff fie
Once a promise thou did me make
That thou would me never forsake
But now I se it is harde
For to trust the wretched world
Fare well masters euerycheone
For your sin look ye morn
and evil creatures loke ye turn
For your name who makes incision
Say it is good contricion
That for sin doth morn
¶Here is a new array
For to walk by the way
Your prayer for to say
¶Here be beds for your devotion
And keep you from all temptation
Let not vice devour
When ye se misdoing men
Good counsel give them
And teach them to amend
¶For my sin I will morn
All creatures I will turn
and when I see misdoing men
Good counsel I shall give them
and exorte them to to amend
¶Then shall ye be an heritour of bliss
Where all joy and mirth is
¶To the which eternal
Go bring the persons all
Here being amen.
Thus have we brought our matter to an end
Before the persons here present
Would every man be content
Least onother day we be shente
¶He thank all this present
Of their meek audience
¶Iesu that sits in heaven so hye
Men and women that here be
amen amen, for charity.
