¶ Lo sirs my master ye se is angry
But this it is tell follies for their proffyt
〈◊〉 warn them for their wealth it is but folly
For strike them on the heal and as much wit
Shall cō forth as at their forehead to {per}scyue it
Go thy way calesto for on my charge
Thy thryft is sealyd up though thou be at large
¶ O how unhappy I am to be trem
For other men wyn by falsehed &amp; flattery
I less for my troth the world doth so ensew
Troth is put back &amp; takyn for folly
Therefore now I will change my copy
If I had done as celystyne bad me
Lalysto his minion styll wold have had me
¶ This gyuyth me warning from hens forward
how to del with him for all thing as he will
I will the same forward or bakward
I will go straight to him and follow him still
Say as he saith be it good or ill
And sith these vowed get good provoking lechery
I trust flattery shall speed as well as bawdery
¶ I pray you cawe this woven here never syn
In faith to entry here I awe half adrad
And yet why so / I may boldly com in
I am sure frow you all I shall not be had
But iesus iesus be these men so wad
On woven as they sey / how should it be
It is but fables and lies ye way trust in
God be here i
who is there
will ye bye any thread
ye mary good water I pray you come in
Lryst save you fair mestres &amp; god be your sped•…
And health be to you &amp; all your kin
And mary god mother that blessyd virgin
Preserve &amp; prosper your womanly personage
And well to enjoy your yough &amp; pusell age
¶ For that time pleasurys are most eschyuyd
And age is the hospital of all manner sykenes
The resting place of all thought vnreleuyd
The sport of time past the end of all quiknes
Neybour to death a dry stoke without swetnes
Discomfort disease all age allowed
A tree without sap that small charge bows
¶ I marvel moder ye speak so much ill
Of age that all folk desire affectuously
They desire hurt for them selfas all of will
And the cause why they desire to come thereby
Is for to lyff for death is so lothly
He that is sorrowful wold lyff to be sorrier
And he that is old wold lyff to be elder
¶ Fair damsel who can show all the hurt of age
His werynes feblenes his discontenting
His childishness frowardness of his rage
wrynkelyng in the face lak of sight and hearing
Holownes of mouth fall of teeth faint of going
And worst of all possessyd with poverty
And the lymmys arestyd with debylite
¶ Moder ye have takyn great pain for age
wold ye not return to the beginning
Follies are they that are past their passage
To begin again which be at the ending
For better is possession than the desiring
I desire to lyff lengger do I well or no.
That ye desire well I thynk not so
¶ For as soon goth to market the lambys fell
As the ship / none so old but may lyff a year
And there is none so young but ye wot well
May dye in a day then no advantage is here
Between youth &amp; age y• matter is clear
with thy fablyng &amp; thy reasoning I wis
I am begylyd but I have known the or this

Thou art sore changed thou may believe me
Fair maydon keep thou well this time of youth
But bewte shall pass at y• last this is truth
¶ yet I am not so old as ye jug me
Good moder I joy much of thine accoyntanaunce
And thy moderly reasons right well please me
And now I thank the here for thy pastaunce
Fare well till a another time yt hap may chance
Again that we two may mete to gedyr
May hap ye have bysynes I know not whether
¶ O angelic image o {per}le so p̄cyous
O how thou spikiest it reioysyth me to here
Know thou not by the divine month gracious
That against the infernal feend lucyfe re
we should not only lyf by bred here
But by our good workys where in I take some pain
if ye know not my mind now all is in veyn
¶ Show me moder hardly all thy necessity
And if I can I shall provide the remedy
My necessity nay god wot it is not for me
As for mine I laft it at home surely
To ete when I will &amp; drink when I am dry
And I thank god ever one penny hath be mine
To by bred when Ilyst &amp; to have. iiii. for wine
¶ Before I was widow I carried never for it
For I had wine enough of mine own to sell
And with a tossed in wine by the fire I could sit
with. ii. dozen sop the collyk to quell
But now with me it is not so well
For I have nothing but that is brought me
In a pitcher pot of quartys scant three
¶ Thus I pray god help them that be noddy
For I speak not for my self alone
But as well for other how ever speed I
The infyrmyte is not mine though that I groan
It is for a another yt I make moan
And not for my self it is a another way
But what I must moan where I dare not say
¶ Say what thou will &amp; for whom thou lest
now gracious damsel I thank you than
That to gyf audience ye be so pressed
with liberal readiness to me old woman
which gyffyth me boldness to show what I can
Of one that lies in danger by sekenes
Remitting his langour to your gētyllnes
¶ what meanyst thou I pray the good moder
Go forth with thy demand as thou hast done
On the one {per}te thou prouokyst me to anger
And on the other side to compassion
I know not how thy answer to fassyon
The words which thou spikiest in my presence
Be so misty / I {per}seyue not thy sentence
¶ I said I laft one in danger of sekenes
Drawing to death for ought that I can se
Now chose you or no to be murderes
Or revive him with a word to come from the
I am happy if my word be of such necessity
To help any crystyn man or ells godd{is} forbod
To do a good dede is liking to god
¶ For good ded{is} to good men be alowable
And specially to noddy aboue all other
And ever to good deeds ye shall find me agreeable
Trusting ye will exhort me to non other
Therefore fere not spek your peticiō good mother
For they that may heal sekefolk &amp; do refuse them
Suerly of their death they can not excuse them
¶ Full well &amp; graciously the case ye consider
For I never beleuyd that god in vayn
wold gyff you such countenance &amp; bewte to gedyr
But charity therewith to relive folk in pain
And as god hath gyffyn you so gyff him again
For folk{is} be not made for them self only
For then they should lyff like best{is} all rudely
¶ Among which best{is} yet some be pitiful
The unicorn humblyth hy•… self to a maid
And a dog in all his power ireful
Let a man fall to ground his anger is delayed
Thus by nature pity is conveyed
The kok when he skrapith &amp; happith mete to find
Lallith for his hen lo se the gentle kind
¶ Should human creaturys than be of cruelnes
Should not they to their neighbours show charity
And specially to them wrappyd in sekenes
Than they that may heal them cause y• infirmyte
Mother without delay for god sake show me
I pray the heartily without more prayeng

To the great boldness of thy demeaning
Fair maiden yet one word now I you pray
Appease we pacyens &amp; here my saying
It Is for a prayer mestres my demanding
That is said ye have of saint appolyne
For the toth ache where of this man is in pine

Saw him armyd he seems a saint george
Rather than to be made in nature forge
¶ An angel thou would judge him I make avow
The gentle narciso was never so fair
That was ināmoryd on his own shadow
wherefore fair maid let thy pity repair
Let mercy be thy mother &amp; thou her heir
This knight whom I come for never seasyth
But cries out of pain that styll encresyth
¶ How long time I pray the hath it holdyn him
I thynk he be. xxiiii. years of age
I saw him born &amp; help for to fold him

Have here my gyrdyll the prayer is not ready
To morrow it shall be / come again secretly

This k•…yght &amp; I both thy bedfolkis shall be

I shall perform that I have you promised
Show to this seek knight in all that I may
Bid him be bold in all things honest
And though he to me as yet be but a gest
If my word or dede his hold may support
I shall not fail and thus bid him take comfort

Now say you now is not this matter carried clean
Can not old celestina her matter speed
A thing not well handlyd is not worth a been
Now know ye by ye •…alf tale what ye hole doth •…eane
These women at the first be angry &amp; furious
Fair we there comes after stormys tempestuous

which lies now languishing in great pain
And show him that he is not remediless
And bear him this to make him glad and fain
And handyll him so that ye shall sey plain

¶ O marvelous god what a dream had I to night
Most terrible vysy on to report and here
I had never none such nor none yerthely wight
Alas when I thynk thereon I quake for fere
It was of melebe•… my daughter dere
God send me good tythyuge of her shortly
For till I here from her I can not be merry
¶ O dere father nothing may me more displease
Nothing may do me more annoyance
Nothing may do me gretter disease
Than to se you father in any perturbans
For me chiefly or for any other chance
But for me I pray you not to be sad
For I have no cause but to be merry and glad
¶ O sweet melebea my daughter dere
I am replete with •…oy and felycyte
For that ye be now in my presens here
As I perceive in Joy &amp; prosperity
From death to life me thynkyth it reuyuyth 〈◊〉
For the fearful dream y• I had lately
what dream sir was that I pray you heartily
¶ Doubtless me though yt I was walking
In a fair orchard where were places two
The one was a hot •…ath wholesome &amp; pleasing
To all people that did repair thereto
To was•…h them &amp; clen•… them from sekenes also
The other a pyt of foul stinking water
shortly they dyed all that there in did enter
¶ And unto this wholesome bath me thought y• ye
In the right path were cōmyng 〈◊〉
But before that me thought that I did see
A foul rough bych aprikeryd cur it was
which strakyng her body along on the gras
And with her tail lykkyd her so that she
Made her self a fair spaniel to be
¶ This bych then me thought met you in the way
Leppyng &amp; fawning upon you a pace
And round a bowt you dydrenne &amp; play
which made you then disport &amp; solas
which lykyd you so well yt in short space
The way to the hot bath anon ye left it
And toke the straight way to the foul pyt
¶ And ever ye looked continually
upon that same bych &amp; somoth her eyed
That ye cain to the fonle pyt brink suddenly
Lvke to have fallyn in &amp; to have been destroyed
which when I saw anon than I cried
Starting in my sleep &amp; therwt did awake
That yet for fere me thynk my body doth quaks
¶ was not this a fcrefull dream &amp; marvelous
I pray you daughter what thynk ye now to this
Hic mes•…ea certo tempore nō •…oquit̄ sed uustu 〈◊◊〉
why speak ye not why be ye now so studious
Is there any thing y• hath chanced you 〈◊〉
I am your father tell me what it is
A las now your dream which ye have expressyd
¶ Hath made me all pensive &amp; sore abashed
I pray you dere daughter now tell me why
Sir I know the canse of your vision
And what your dredefull dream doth signify
There of wold I fain now have noticion
Alas dere fade•… alas what have I done
Offendyd god as a wretch unworthy
wherein / despair not god is full of mercy
¶ Than on my knees now I fall down
And of god chefely asking forgyfnes
And next of you for in to oblivion
I have put your doctrine &amp; lessons doubtless
Fere not daughter I am not merciless
I trust ye have not so greatly offendyd
But that right well it may be amendyd
¶ ye have fostered me up full lovingly
In virtuous dis•…plyne which is the right path
To all grace &amp; vert•…w which doth signify
By your dream y• •…ayre pleasant wholesome bath
The foul pyt whereof ye dremyd which hath
Destroyed so many betokneth •…ise &amp; syn
In which alas Thad almost fallyn In
¶ The prikyeryd cur &amp; the foul •…ych
which made her self so smooth &amp; fair to see
Betokenyth an old queen a bawdy wych
Lallyd celystyne that wo might she be
which with her fair word ay so •…swadydme
That she had almost brought me here unto
To fulfil the foul lust of calis•…
¶ Alas dere daughter I taught you a lesson
wh•…ch way ye should attain unto vertew
That was every morning to say an orason
Prayeng god for grace all vice to eschew
O dere fader that lesson I have kept true
which preseruyd me / for though I did cōsēt
In mind / yet had he never his intent
¶ The verteu of that prayer I se well on thing
hath preseruyd you from the shame of that sin
But because ye were somewhat cōsentyng
ye have offended god greatly therein
wherefore daughter ye must now begin
humbly to beseech god of his mercy
For to forgive you your syn &amp; misery
¶ O blissed lord &amp; fader celestial
whose infinite mercy no tong can express
Though I be a sinner wretch of wrechis all
yet of thy great mercy grant me forgifnes
Full sore I repent my sy•… I cōfese
Intending hens forth never to offend more
Now humbly I beseech thy mercy therefore
¶ Now yt is well said mine one fayte daughter
Stand up therefore or I know verily
That god is good &amp; merciful ever
To all sinners which will ask mercy
And be repentant &amp; in will clearly
To syn no more he of his great goodness
will grant them therefore his grace &amp; forgive•…es
¶ Lo here ye may see what a thing it is
To bring up young people verteously
In good custom / foe•… gre•… doth never mys
To them that use good prayers daily
which hath preseruyd this maid vndoutydly
And kept her frō actual dede of shame
Brought her to grace preseruy•… her good name
¶ wherefore ye virgins &amp; 〈◊〉 maidens all
Unto this example now take good h•…de
Serve god daily the soon•… ye shall
To honest &amp; goodness no dout proceed
And god shall send you ever his grace at need
To wtstand all evil temptacions
That shall come to you by any occasions
¶ And ye fodders mothers &amp; other which be
Rulers of young folk your charge is doubtless
To bring them up verteously &amp; to see
Them occupied styll in some good bysynes
Not in idol pastime or vnthryftynes
But to tech them some art craft or learning
whereby to be able to get their lyffyng
¶ The bryngers up of youth in this region
have done great harm because of their neclygēs
Not putting them to learning nor occupacyons
So when they have no craft nor sciens
And com to mans state ye see thex{per}ience
That many of them compellyd be
To beg or steal by very necessity
¶ But if there be therefore any remedy
The heads &amp; rulers must first be diligent
To make good laws &amp; execute them straytely
Upon such mistress that be neclygent
Alas we make no laws but ponyshment
when men have offendyd / but laws evermore
wold be made to prevent the cause before
¶ if the cause of the mischief were seen before
which by cōiecture to fall be most likely
And good laws &amp; ordinances made therefore
to put a way the cause / yt were best remedt
what is the cause that there be so many
Theft &amp; robberies / it is be cause mē be
Driven thereto by need &amp; poverty
¶ And what is the verey cause of that need
Be cause they •…abur not for their lyffyng
And trewth is they can not well labour in dede
Be cause in youth of their ydyll vpbryngyng
But this thing shall never come to reforming
But the world cōtynually shall be nought
As long as young pepyll be euell vpbrought
¶ wherefore the eternal god that raynyth on hye
Send his merciful grace &amp; influence
To all governors that they circumspectly
May rule their inferiors by such prudence
To bring them to vertew &amp; dew obedyeus
And that they &amp; we all by his great mercy
May be {per}tenors of his blessyd glory.

A dyaloge between the Merchant the
Knight and the ploughmen disputing who is a verey Gen∣tylman
&amp; who is a Noble man and how men should
come to auctoryte / compiled in manner of an en∣terlude with divers toys &amp; gifts eddied thereto
to make merry pastime and disport.
O what a great wealth and prosperyte
It is to any reme where merchants be
Having fre liberty and intercourse also
All marchaundyse to cōuey to and fro
Which thing I have used and the verey fet found
And thereby gotton many a thousand pound
Wherefore now be cause of my great riches
Thoroughowt this land in every place doubtless
I am magnified and greatly regardyd
And for a wise and noble man estemyd
Moister merchant I here you right well
But now in presumption me thynk ye excel
To call yourself noble in presence here
I wis men know what your ancestors were
And of what great stock descendid ye be
Your fadyr was but a black smith perde
¶Why sir what than what be you I pray you
¶Mary I am a gentleman I wold ye know
And may despond yearly v.C. mark land
And I am sure all that ye have in hand
Of yearly rent is not worth v. markys
¶But I wold thou knewist for all thy krakkys
I am able to bye now all the land
That thou hast and pay for it out of hand
Which I have got by mine own labour and wit
¶Yet art thou but a chorle and I have a scorn
Thou should cōpare with me a gentleman born
¶Why what cellist thou a gentleman tel me
¶Mary I call them gentylmen that be
Born to great landys by inheritance
As mine ancestors by cōtynuaunce
Have had this v.C. year of whom now I
Am descended and commyn lynyally
Beryng the same name and armies also
That they bare this v.C. year agoo
Mine ancestors also have ever be
Lords Knights and in great auctoryte
Captains in the war and governors
And also in time of peas great rulers
And thyn were never but artysycers
As smith{is} mason{is} carpenters or weavers
¶All that is trewth I will not deny now
Yet I am more gentleman born than thou
For I call him a gentleman that gentilly
Doth gyf unto other men lovingly
Such thing as he hath of his own pper
But he that takes ought away from a another
And doth gyf him no thing again therefore
Ought to be called a chorle evermore
But mine ancestors have giffyn always
To thyn ancestors such thing as they
By their labours did truly get and wyn
For mine ancestors belted houses wherein
Thine ancestors have had their dwelling place
Also mine ancestors have made tolis
To all manner crafti men belonging
Whereby clothis and every other thing
Where of thyn ancestors need have had
With the same tolys have ever be made
So mine ancestors have gyffin their labours
Ever to cōfort and help thyn ancestors
¶I deny that ever thauncestours of thine
Did ever gif to the ancestors of mine
At any time any thing except that they
Gafe some what therefore other ware or money
¶Mary god a mercy Iohn for that now
That is euyn a pig of our own sow
How can lords &amp; estates have ought in store
Except thartyfycers do get it before
For all metalis be dyggyd first by myners
And after wrought by the artificers
woll fell and every other thing
That is necessary to monies covering
And all other things that men use &amp; were
Is al way made by the artificer
I grant that the artificers do make it
But be cause commonly they have little wit
Gentylmen that have landys &amp; dominion
Of all such riches have most possession
For reason will ever it should so be
wise men to have follies in captyuyte
Mary as for wit &amp; subtle inuencyou
Mine ancestors with thine may make cō{per}icon
For though my fader were a smith what than
yet was he a marvelous quyk wyttyd man
And could work as well for his {per}t
As any in this land using that art
And deuyse new fassyons in chynges that he made
That every man to bye his ware was glad
And carve &amp; grave in iron &amp; steal
Both Image &amp; letters marvelously wele
And there on ley gold &amp; gilt it also
Fine &amp; pure as any gold smith could do
My grauntfader also was a mason
Of great wit as any in this region
And could byld a castle &amp; tour right well
In which some of thy kynnys men now do dwell
where in aperyth right good masonry
with Immagys &amp; armies wrought curiously
My great graundfadyr lo was a weuer
Of wollyn yarn &amp; of other ger
And made marvelous pleasant works to be hold
Lynyn dya{per} silk &amp; cloth of gold
All such subtle things as I have rehersyd lo
Mine ancestors by their wits could work &amp; do
And as for thine ancestors I know no thing
They could do bi their wits worth of praising
But use occupy &amp; wast ever more
Such things as mine ancestors 〈◊〉 before
And thou &amp; thie ancestors 〈◊◊◊〉
Of such things wrought 〈◊◊◊〉
Of other men ought not be praised therefore
But the praise ought to be given ever more
To the artificer which by his wit
It deuysyd and so cōnyngly wrought it
wherefore if thou sey that wit &amp; policy
Be the thing{is} pertaining to gentry
Thyn ancestors may never cōpare with, mine
For their act{is} prove them wiser than thine
For thyn did never no thing in their days
Concerning quyk wit that was worthy prays
yes I wis lewd Iauell I wold thou knewist it
Mine ancestors have had more wisdom &amp; wit
Than thine have had &amp; could do also
Many things that thine could never do
for in the country at sessyons and syse
They have be elect to be Justice
And for theyer wit and great discretion
They have Iuggyd and donne correccyon
Upon thine ancestors artificers
That have made false warys &amp; ben dysseyuers
And help for to maintain every thing
That is to the comyn weith pteynyng
They have ben also in time of war
Both in this land &amp; other courreys far
Dukrs &amp; leders of the hole army
And by their wits &amp; warly polycy
Study forecast &amp; diligent travail
Have won many a great fyld &amp; battle
And thine ancestors that were there
were never able to bear shyld nor sphere
And were never but soldiers &amp; pyoners
Nor never had wisdom to be rulers
But because mine ancestors have ever be
Discrete &amp; wise they have had anctoryte
Nay nay thine ancestors cam never all
To auctoryte for wisdom p̄ncypall
For though sōe were wise yet some of thē again
Had small discretion little wit or brain
But because of the long cōtynuannce
Of their great possessions by inheritance
By the foolish manner of the world we see
For that cause ever they have had auctorite
And I say that good reason agreth to it
For though the fader have no great wit
The soon that is wise should never the more
Lose his land or auctoryte therefore
For he that by study diligence &amp; pain
Great landys or possessions doth attain
His own life is to short &amp; to lyte
For to take the fruit of his merit
Reason would therefore that after his life
His heyrs before strangers have p̄rogatyfe
And the cōtynuaunce of such possessions
Makyth noble men &amp; gentle conditions
And they whose blot hath long continued
As gentylmen so they should be honoured
And so mine ancestors long time have be
Great possyssyoners and in auctoryte
Therefore considering my great lynage
My blot my noble birth and parentage
Thou art not able to compare with me
Another in gentylnes nor in nobylyte
¶Nowhere is bybbyll babbyll clytter clatter
I hard never of so foolish a matter
But by goddess body to speak the troth
I am better than other of you both
Avaunt kanker de chorle fro whens cōmyst thou
Mary foolish peevish daw even fro my plow
Now say would any thing there wtall
ye mary thou lewyd villain &amp; rud rascal
It is for the full ill besoming
To {per}turb any gentylmens talking
¶Gentylmen ye gentylmen Iak hearing
Put your shone in your bosom for weryng
I account myself by goddess body
Better than you both and more worthy
Avaunt knave get the out of the gate
Or I shall lay my sword on thy pate
That shall I prove I make god avow
Never in better time have at the now
Now hold thy hand fellow I the pray
And harkyn what I shall to the say
Sey knave say what can sey
Hold thy hand I pray the &amp; com no nor
I am a merchant &amp; no man of war
Thou art not honest I tell the plainly
To make any quarrel here so suddenly
To {per}turb our cōmunycacyon
Here ye may se sirs by goddess passion
Two proud follies make a crakkyng
And when it cōmyth to point dare do no thing
Our cōmyng hyder &amp; our intent
is not to fight but by way of argument
Every man to show his opinion
To see who could show the best reason
To prove him self noble &amp; most gentleman
By god all the reasons sith ye began
That ye have made thereof be not worth a fly
¶No sir I pray the than tell me why
¶First as touching nobleness I say
There is another of you both did {pro}ue or lay
Any of your acts whereby that ye
Should in reason {pro}ue you noble to be
Or thereby deserve any manner praising
But all the effect of your arguing
To prove your nobleness was but only
Of the deddys &amp; act{is} of your ancestry
And of the act{is} that your ancestors did before
ye at the nobler never the more
¶As touching my self I dare make compison
Of as noble deeds as he hath any done
For I am &amp; have ben one of the chivalry
At the cōmaundement of my prince euerredy
And every time of war have be captain
And leder of a .M. men or twain
And with horse &amp; harnes sphere and sheld
Have Ioydyd my body in every field
The rent{is} of my landys have spend liberally
And kept a great house continually
And help to ponyssh theuys &amp; brybers always
To the great tranqaylyte of my contrary
And you moister merchaūt wit never take labour
Except it be for your {pro}ffet and lucoure
Go to go to now master merchant
There is a reason that gyuyth you a taunt
I trow more than you can answer well
¶Nay I wis pyvysh &amp; rude Iak Iauell
I can make an answer so substancyally
where to another of you is able to reply
If thou can answer my reason do
That can I well doo. P. Then go to foal go to
I say the comyn well of every land
In fete of marchauntdyse doth principally stand
For if our cōmoditees be vtteryd for nought
In to strange landis and no riches brought
Hydyr therefore / we should come to beggary
And all men dryffyn to lyf in misery
Thē we noble merchants that in this reame be
what a great wealth to this land do we
we utter our warys &amp; by theirs good chepe
And bring them hyder that great {pro}ffet
And pleasure daily cōmyth to this region
Too all manner people that here do won
Forthermore ye see well with your eyes
That of strange landis the cōmodytees
we have such need of them that be there
That in no wise we may them for bear
As oil silks fruit &amp; spices also
Gold silver yryn &amp; other metal is moo
All drāmys &amp; druggys longing to physique
which men must needs have when they be seek
which in this reame can not well grow
Our cōtrey is to cold &amp; not hot I now
with out which things we should life in misery
And oft times for lak of them we should dye
And I spend my study &amp; labour continually
And cause such things to come hyder daily
For the comfort of this land &amp; cōmen wealth
And to all the people great, pffer &amp; health
And for such noble deeds reason will than
That I ought to be called a noble man
And another of you both that here now be
In nobleness may accompare with me
Now well hit by gods body well hit
Of one that hath but little wit
Answer me one word first I pray the
what is the noblest thing that can be
what say thou thereto thy self let see
Is not yt the noblyst thing in dede
That of all other things hath lest need
As god which beynith etern in bliss
Is not he the noblest thing yt is
yes mary no man in reason can that deny
¶well than there is no reason thereof why
But because he is the thing omnipotent
And is in hun self so sufficient
And needs the help of no nothyr thing
To the help of his glorious being
But every other thing hath need of his aid
¶Mary that is very trough &amp; well said
And likewise yt thing that hath most need
Is the thing that is most wretched
So sufficiency is ever nobleness
And necessity is ever wrechydnes
And he that hath more need of that thing
For the p̄teruacyon of his living
Then his fellow hath his fellow must ned{is} be
By this same reason more noble than he
what than .P. by the same reason it {pro}uith lo
ye be but caitiff{is} &amp; wrechis both two
And by the same reason {pro}ue I shall
That I am the noblyst man of vs all
For I have need of no manner thing
That ye can do to help of my lyffyng
For every thing whereby ye do lyf
I noryss it &amp; to you both do gyf
I plow I till &amp; I ster the ground
whereby I make the corn to habounde
whereof there is made both drink &amp; bred
wych the which daily ye must nedis be fed
I noryss the cattle &amp; fowlys also
Fish &amp; herbs &amp; other thing mo
Fell herr &amp; woll which the bestis do bear
I noryssh &amp; preserve which ye do were
which if ye had not no dowt ye should
Starve for sak of clothis because of cold
So both you should die or live in necessity
If ye had not cōfort &amp; help of me
And as for your fine cloth &amp; costly array
I cannot see whi ye ought or my
Call your self noble because ye were it
which was made bi other menis labour &amp; wit
And also your delicate drinks &amp; viand
Bi other menis labours be made so pleasant
Therefore master merchant now to you I sei
I can not see but I am able &amp; my
Lyf without you or your purueaunce
Live without you or your purveyance
For of foot &amp; cloth I have suffisaunce
Of my self for lyffing necessary
And now sir knight to you I sey plainly
I see not that ye can any thing do
For the cōmyn well or ought longing thereto
But each man being in auctoryte
Having wit may do it as well as ye
Therefore to spek now of necessity
There is another of you both but ye be
In more need than I therefore I sey plain
I am more noble than other of you twain
Now that is a foolish reason so god me save
For by the same reason thou would have
Every best fish &amp; other foul than
To be more noble of birth than a man
For man hath more need of bodily covering
Than they have for they need no thing
The best{is} have herr &amp; also a thik skin
The fish skalis or shelis to keep their bodies in
The foulis fethirs &amp; so every thing
Bi nature hath his {pro}per covering
Save man himself which is born all nakyd
And therefore he should be than most wrechyd
¶Mary no man can make a better reason
For that is a sure &amp; a true cōclusyon
For if a child when he is first born
were not help &amp; coueryd he were soon lorn
He hath no strenght to help him never a dell
yet bestis have power to help them self well
¶So cōsideryng māns body in dede
A best is more noble &amp; man more wrechyd
Be cause he hath need of many mo things
Than bestis have to help of theyer lyffyngis
Also man must daily labour &amp; sweet
To get him sustynaunce as drink &amp; mete
The ground he must dig &amp; the bestis kill
For breed and mete his body to fill
Grapis fruit and herbs norssh diligently
To make good drinks to refresh his body
But all brut bestis have covering natural
Sufficient to cover their bodies with all
And find their foot ever on the ground ready
with out any pain labour or study
So every man by reason of his body
Is more wrechyd &amp; in more misery
Than best{is} be / yet thus not withstanding
Man is most noble of creature{is} living
Not by his body for that is impotent
But by his soul being so excellent
For by reason of his soul intyllectyue
He subde with all other best{is} alive
And cōpellyth all other bestis that be
By his wit to relive his necessity
But bestis have no wit them self to defend
Nor can get no more than god hath them send
For take any best that weryth heer
And do clyp it of bare a gayns winter
That best hath no manner of polecy
To get other covering for his body
Of cloth nor skins nor hath no wit
To put it upon him though one have made it
Nor can byld no house nor kyndyl no fire
To warm his body if need should require
But yet a man hath wit &amp; understanding
For to help him self in every such thing
So man for his soul intellectual
Is most noble creature of bestis all
¶That is a verey good &amp; preguant reason
yet me thinks thou make a digression
From the argument that we first began
which was to {pro}ue who was most gentleman
which we disputyd I wold thou had hard it
¶Tush I hard what ye said every whit
¶Then show thy reason therein or thou go
¶Nay be god I have some what ells to do
I must go by me a halporth of gresse
The spokes of my cart therewith to dress
Trow ye that I will leave my bysynes
For your babelyng pomp &amp; folysshnes
Nay by sent mary I will not do so
For I can now to the market goo
And for an haipeny as much gresse by
As shall cost me in our town a penny
And I tell the plainly with out any bossed
A halpeny is as well sauid as lost
¶Straw for an halpeny therein is no wast
Tarry with vs a while phapps thou mast
By our acquaintance now here get more
Than thou got with thy cart this monyth before
¶Straw for thy council torde a fart
Trow I will gyf up my plow or cart
And follow thy foolish appetite and mind
Nay I am not yet so mad nor so blind
For when I am at my cart of plow
I am more merrier than other of you
I wold not change my lyf nor my lyffyng
For to be made a great lord or a king
There is no joy nor pleasure in this world here
But hill belly fill and make good chere
Be if prince lord gentleman or knave
Hit is all the joy that here be can have
But these covetous and ambitious wretches
They set there myndys in honour and riches
So much that they be never content
So they lyf ever in pain and torment
But a man that can this means find
To have foot and cloth and a merry mind
And to desire no more than is needful
That is in this world the lyf most joyful
Which life in this world no man shall acquire
Till he subdue his insaciat desire
¶I see well thou has a cursed apish wit
Then if thou will depart I pray the yet
Come again when thy bisines is doo
¶For what intent now should I do so
¶For we will in our old argument proceed
Who should be called a gentleman in dede
And we would be glade to here thy reason
¶I will come again upon a condition
That ye will wait upon me both twain
And be not out of the way when I come again
¶We will not be far hens P. then I will not fail
¶Then I pray the let not the pmise quail
¶Lo here is my finger now trust me well
I will come again if I have my heal
For by god I promise you one thing
I am as true of my word as the King
But if I find you not here then by my trough
I shall call you oppenly false knauys both
¶Thou shalt find us true in every thing
¶I thynk so / except lying and stelyng
Then far well for a season a dew
Then fare ye well both I dare say as true
As some that be tied in newgate
well now he is gone god speed well his gate
But what shall we do now the mean season
Let us take now some recreation
And come again here and keep our poyntment
Now thereto I am right well content
And in the mean while good lord of thy grace
Preserve all the people here in this place
Here I may walk and wander to and fro
But I se not them which I wold speak to
Yes by rode here we be both twain
To whom thou dydyst promise to mete here again
To dispute the question that we began
which of us could prove him most gentleman
Thou seydest thou hardiest our arguments all
so did I another good nor substance all
For thy foolish and pyuysh opinion
was because of the great dominion
Of the landis and rentis where to thou wast bore
which thyn ancestors had long time before
Thou thynkyst thy self a gentleman to be
Ant that is a foolish reason semyth no
For when adam dolf and eve span
who was then a gentleman
But then cam the churl and gederyd good
And there began first the gentle blood
And I thynk verily ye do believe
That we cam all of adam and eve
Then to speak by reason great possessions
Make no gentylmen but gentle conditions
That is the cause and best reason why
One should be called a gentleman truly
And forthermor mark well this reason then
If a mānis ancestors have be gentylmen
And virtuous and good to commyn well
That ought to be reputyd never adell
To the praise of the child which doth refuse
Such good cōdycyons &amp; the cōtrary use
But he ought to be dyspraysyd the more
Because his ancestors hath shewid him before
A precedent of gentylnes &amp; vertew
which good example he doth not infew
For the gentylnes of hysblode clery
In him doth decay &amp; utterly dye
So he that used cōdycyons virtuous
Though that his ancestors were vicious
Ought not to be dyspraysyd therefore
But ought to be honoryd &amp; praysyd the more
yet me thynkyth more honour should be gyffyn
To him which is of noble blood &amp; kin
Then if thou will loke honoured to be
Be cause of thy blot then mark well &amp; see
The vylyst beggar that goth by the door
Had ye not both one god &amp; creature
ye cam of one first stoke &amp; {pro}genye
Both of adam &amp; eve ye will not deny
The beggar &amp; thou were both do wtles
Lonseyuyd &amp; born infield &amp; uncleanness
Thy blood &amp; the beggars of one colour be
Thou art as apt to take seknes as he
if thou be in the body woundyd
Thy flessh is as ill as his to be helyd
Alas I have known many or this
So proud of their birth that all theyrlyffys
wold gyf them to no labour nor learning
which brought them to miserable ending
That in poverty wrechydly did dye
Or fallyn to theft &amp; hangyd therefore full hye
So I sey vertew &amp; good cōdycyons than
Is that which makyth the very gentleman
And though the fadyr may bequeath to his son
Hyts riches his land &amp; his possess
yon
yet may he nothyr gyf nor vequeth
Unto him in no wise after his death
His vertew nor his gentle cōdyeyons
They can not descend as other possessions
And if thou will be a gentleman needs
Thou must than use vertew &amp; gentle deeds
Why desire men then praise evermore
Of the acts of their ancestors done before
One cause there of is for lak of learning
They {per}seyue not the reason of the thing
Another is be cause there be many
That call them self gentylmen unworthy
which life voluptuously &amp; bestial
And do no good in the world at all
But lyse in pride sloth &amp; vnthrystynes
And be cause they have no manner goodness
Nor {pro}perte nor vertew in them where by
Any man should thynk them any praise worthy
Therefore they seek for cōmendacyon
Of the act{is} that their ancestors have done
Then Imeruell men desire to be called
Of the blot of them that excellyd
In worldly honour as king{is} &amp; em{per}ours
where some were tyrant{is} some were cōquerours
And few desire to be called of their blot
which have ben called Just mē virtuous &amp; good
And used indifferent Justice &amp; equyte
Mekenes abstynens or wilful poverty
if I should tell the the verey cause true
It is because they love no such vertew
which vertew &amp; gentle cōdycyons should be
Longing to gentylmen of {pro}perte
If gentle cōdycyons be the cause lo
Tken will I compare with both you two
For I have used ever gentle manner
And so have mine ancestors that before were
For fursto: all when this world began
Long after there were but few people than
Men had sufficient of every thing
with out great labour for foot &amp; clothing
All thing was in cōmyn among them doubtless
But after ward when people did increase
Each man to increase his pleasure &amp; volupte
Of good{is} &amp; lands desired {pro}perte
wereof great stiff &amp; debate did arise
Thē such as my aūcestours were that werewyse
Did study to make laws how the people might be
Lyssyng to gedyr in peas &amp; unite
And agayns enmiys always defendyd
The people that tyllyd the ground &amp; laboryd
The people pseyuyng than their goodness
Their great wit discretion &amp; gentylnes
were cōtent to gyfe them {per}t of the {pro}ffet
Coming of their land{is} which they did get
As corn cattle &amp; such thyn{is} as they wan
But after when that coin of money began
They chaūgid those seuenuse &amp; were cōtent
To gyfe them in money an ānyell rent
So for their good &amp; vicious cōdycyons
They cam first to lād{is} &amp; possessions
So possessions began &amp; were first found
Upon a good &amp; reasonable ground
By gog{is} sweet body thou lie falsely
All possessions began trust of tyranny
For when people began first to increase
Some gafe them self all to Idylnes
And wold not labour but take by violence
That other men gat by labour &amp; diligence
Than they that labouryd were fain to gyfe
Them {per}t of their getting{is} in peas of life
Or ell{is} for their landis money a portion
So possessions began by extortion
And when such extorsyoners had oppressyd
The laboring people than they ordeynyd
And made laws marvelous strait &amp; hard
That their heir{is} might enjoy it afterword
So the law of inhetyaunce was first begone
which is a thing agayns all good reason
That any inheritance in the world should be
That is a shameful opinion semyth me
For when I have labouryd &amp; by great study
Gat &amp; purcheysyd landys truly
It is good reason that I have liberty
To gyfe those landis to whom it likes me
Or ell{is} to let them descend lynyyally
To my child or cosyn of my blot most ny
For inheritance must needs be a good thing
Because so much good thereof is {pro}cedyng
Every man to his blot such love doth bear
Because the land shall descend to his heir
Be will byld thereon &amp; the land improve
And make corn &amp; grass to increase &amp; grow
Graft fruit set trecs &amp; norysh timber
And to increase fish make pondys with water
Stoke bushes &amp; wedes which destroy herbage
And all baren ground bring to tillage
And amend the hye ways that be there about
And do many other good dedis no dowt
For the {pro}fet of his heyrys that shall be
And for the cōmyn wealth of his country
which thing{is} surely he wold never intend
if the land should not to his heir descend
¶By thy reason no nothyr thing is meant
But a good dede upon an yuell intent
when men for love or pryd do such good dedis
The devil therefore shall quyt thē their medic
whiter god or the devil quyt them therefore
Is now to our purpose never the more
For their mind{is} &amp; intent{is} no man can tell
But touching in herytaunce this I wot well
Much good cōmyth thereof &amp; dayli doth grow
Nay much Ill cōmyth thereof I shall prove how
For these men that be of great possessions
Unto their blot have such affeccyons
If any land like them that lies ny them
Of their pore neghbors they will destroy them
Or by extort means they will them compel
The land for half the worth to them to sell
And when they lake money they will always
Ever borrow &amp; never willing to pay
And when they shall dye ye see the ex{per}ience
Few of them have remorse of cōsyens
To make any manner restitution
Of any land so wrongfully gotton
Thou hast spoke fore agayns gentylmen
But what seyst thou of merchant{is} then
Many be good and worshipful also
And many charitable dedis they do
Byld churchys &amp; amend the hye ways
Make almys howsys &amp; help many decays
But some be couerous &amp; full falsely
Get their good is by dysseyt &amp; usury
And when they have a .M. li. in their confers
They will rathyr suffer their neighbours
To starve for hunger &amp; cold &amp; to dye
Or they will gyfe to help them a penny
And yet more over when any of them be
Promotyd to rule or auctoryte
They disdain all learning law &amp; reason
And Jug all by will &amp; affection
Thou art but a rayler to speak so sore
Again gentylmen &amp; merchant{is} evermore
Be not ploughmen &amp; other that dryfe the cart
And such rustical felows as thou art
False shrews &amp; life as viciously also
As gentylmen of land{is} &amp; merchant{is} do
yes this vylleyn carters almost echon
Have another cōscyens nor devotion
For bribe &amp; steal every thing they will
If they may secretly come theruntyll
And as for prayer &amp; divine service
They love them in no manner wise
Nor neuyr would labour nor work do
If need of lyffyng drofe them not thereto
yet gentylmen &amp; the rich merchant{is} that be
Use much more vice &amp; iniquyte
why thynkyst all merchant{is} &amp; gentylmen nought
Nay I sey not so that is not my thought
I am not yet so foolish nor so mad
For I know many good though some be bad
yet some will suffer his dett{is} unpaid to be
And dye and Ieo{per}d his soul rather than he
wyil any of his land{is} mynysh and impair
That should after his death come to his heir
And some of them so proud be of their blot
And use small vertew and doo little good
But gyfe all their myndys and their study
To oppress the pore people by tyranny
And some of them thynk this for a surete
It is the most honour to them that can be
To the able for to doo extortion
And to maintain it without punycyon
Bi goggrs sweat body thou art a stark knave
Noble men and gentylmen so to deprave
what thou proud horesō foal whō dost thou knave
I trow thou would a good blow or two have
with a good whypstoke to tech the courtesy
Avaunt beggarly knave I the defy
what will thou wage battle by &amp; by now
That shall I prove straight I make god avow
Keep the peace masters hold your hādys for shame
To make this besynes ye be greatly to blame
ye will disturb all this hole company
Nay mary it is a cause to make them merry
To walk such a proud fool is but sport &amp; gāe
By cokkys body were not for wordly shame
I should cut thy flesh or ell{is} see thy heart blot
Sir hold your tōg your words be nothing good
we lose here with this lewyd altereacyon
Much good pastime and recreation
why what better pastime her can thou have
Then to here one to call an other knave
And see such a proud fool walked with a whip
But I love it not therefore of felyshyp
Leave this brabbling and with good argument
Try the matter that is nosed cōuenyent
Nay I will try it how so ever he will
Be it with words or ded{is} I will answer him styll
For be god if he will not be cōtent
To be cōcludyd by good argument
I will cōclud him one way or that I goo
Or I shall {pro}ue it on his pate that shall I doo
Thow spikiest like a clerk that hath little wit
when a case is put if he can not soil it
By no manner reason that he can ley
Then will he answer him this wise &amp; sey
Beware what ye sey sir now I advise you
for it is treason or herysy that ye spek now
To the intent to rebuke him opynly
Before the vnlernyd people that stand thereby
And if he can no colour of such thing find
Then will he vex and chafe in his mind
And cast owt some lewd word{is} of quarrelling
To torn the hole matter to chiding &amp; fighting
And so dost thou now like one that were mad
Nay I wold thou knewist thou foolish lad
I am another mad nor drunken yet
For mine opinion I have well {pro}uyd it
By substantial reason and argument
That inheritance is not convenient
And showed better reasons than thou can doo
Nay thy reasons may soon be answered unto
For god defend that estates of inheritance
Should be destroyed for by that good ordinance
Gentylmen of lands vndoutydly
Bring up their children full honourably
Some put to the scole to learn cōnynge
To instruct the people in virtuous living
Some made to be actyfe in martial ded{is}
Able to defend the land when need is
And the rustical people that have no land
Such thing{is} be not able to take in hand
wherefore if we should destroy inheritance
we should destroy all good rule and ordinance
But such men as have great rent{is} and land{is}
And no estate but term of their lives
And every thing thereon will norysh and save
For the great zele &amp; love that they only have
To the cōmyn wealth of their country
And for god sake lo these people be they
That be worthy to have possessions
And such people of vertuouse conditions
And no another should be chosyn governors
&amp; they should have lād{is} to maintain their honours
Term of their lives as long as they take pain
For the cōmyn wealth this is good reason plain
So that noman ought to have any land
But such as be apt and have charge in hand
For the cōmyn wealth as princes and rulers
Bishop{is} curate{is} preachers and teachers
Jugs ministers and other officers
That of the cōmyn wealth be executors
And valiant men of the chivalry
That be bound to defend the people daily
Such men as be apt to all such thing{is}
Should have land{is} to maintain their lyffyng{is}
So inheritance is not besemynge
To let them have land{is} that cā do no such thing
Nor I thynk it not reasonable another
One man to lyf by labour of an another
For ych man is borne to labour truly
As a bird is to fl naturally
Nor a man ought not to have such liberty
To lefe land{is} to his child where by that he
Shall lust for to life in sloth &amp; gloteny
Compellyd to do nought but life voluptuously
There is always good remedy for that
That is to compel them to do some what
So that ych man having inheritance
Have some auctoryce and governance
wherein he should take payne and besynes
To coustrayn him to eschew Idelnes
Then this great mischief should follow of hit
Oft times they should rule that have little wit
Or disposyd to be proud &amp; covetous
Or to life after their lusts voluptuous
which if such men had auctoryte
Many thing{is} no dowte mys orderyd should be
where Justice should be / there wold be tyranny
where peas should be war debat &amp; envy
So there is no good reason that I can se
To prove that any inheritance should be
yes that shall I prove by good auctoryte
For rede in the bible and thou shalt therein see
God said to abraham tibi dabo
Terram hanc et semen tuo
which is as much to say to expound yt true
I shall gyfe this land to the and thyn yssew
Here is a good prove that it was gods will.
That Abrahā and his blot should continue still
As possessyoners and have the governance
Of that land as their propre inheritance
Thou answer me now even like a foal
As some of these fond clarks that go to scole
when one puts of them a subtle question
Of philosophy to be provide by reason
when they have all their wits &amp; reason spend
And can not tell how their part to defend
Than they will aledge some auctoryte
Of the laws or else of deuynite
which in no wise men may deny
And yet ye know well that of philosophy
The principles oft contraryant be
Unto the very ground{is} of deuynite
For the philosophers agree here unto
Quote mūdus fuit semper ab eterno
And deuynys quote in principio oim
Creauit deus terram et celum
But thou did promise openly even now
Only by natural reason to prove how
That inheritance ought for to be had
¶By gogges body sirs I hold you both mad
ye be like some woman that I know well
when they would any matter unto a man tell
They will tell .xx. talys by the way
Nothing to purpose to the matter that they
Did first intend to tell and declare
And in like manner now both ye do fare
For ye dispute now whytheyr inheritance
Be a reasonable thing or a good ordinance
which is a matter no thing {per}teynyng
To the question moved at the begynnying
For the question was which of vs all three
Could prove himself most gentleman to be
As touching that we have all spoke &amp; said
Each man for his {per}t as much as can be said
Nay I have yet reasons last whereby I can
{pro}ue my self of vs all most gentleman
That another of you both can void by reason
If thou have ought ell{is} to say now speak on
Then to you both answer me this short clause
Is not gētyll cōdycyons the most prīcypall cause
To make one to be a gentleman
Peradventure it may be so what than
{per}adventure quoth a
Nay I shall {pro}ue that by examples many on
For music makyth one a musycyon
Grāmer to be good gram̄areon
And also geomytry a godd geometryeyon
And chorlysh conditions a chorle for to be
And so of every other estate &amp; degre
And where gentle conditions be doubtless
In any {per}son there is gentyllnes
Than as vertew makyth a good man
So gentle conditions a gentleman
All those point{is} I thynk must needs graūtyd be
what arguyst more therot forth let vs see
How seyst than to pride wrath &amp; ēnuy
They be nought &amp; evil I thynk verily
what is mekenes pacyens &amp; charity
Euerychone a gentle &amp; good {pro}{per}te
what is covetous &amp; lyberalyte
The first good the other nought for surete
what is gloteny sloth &amp; lechery
They be nought all who can that deny
what abstynens good besynes &amp; chastyte
Virtuous &amp; gentle {pro}pertees they be
Sith ye have graūytyd this I shall prove plain
I am a gentleman so is none of your ••own
First for pride your raymēt showed what ye be
L. i.
For ye will never be content except that ye
Have the finest cloth &amp; silk for to were
Of orient colours &amp; all your ger
So costly / your housys gilt gloriously
As though ye wold therein your self deify
ye covet evermore good{is} land{is} &amp; rent
what so ever ye get yet never content
wrathful ye be moved to anger anon
And envious disdaining every man
And as for me I am content always
with a pore cottage &amp; simple array
I disdain no man &amp; yet patiently
Can suffer to be called knave and not angry
Sometime I call him knave again in hast
And when I have said my anger is past
ye have your beds so pleasant &amp; soft
wherein ye ease your self to long and to oft
which makyth your bodies so tender to be
that ye can not endure labour like me
with no manner course foot ye will be fed
But with pleasant wynys &amp; most whitest breed
with flesh &amp; fish most delicate &amp; fat
All fruit{is} &amp; spices that can be gat
And when ye have had such pleasant refeccyons
To assuage your carnal insurreccyons
what so ever she be wife widow or maid
If she come in the way she shall be assayed
Thou least sklāderours chorle for I thīk of troth
Thou vsyst such vyse more then we both
Nay by cokk{is} body I use no such life
For I am content with blak maud my wife
Trow ye yt I care for these nise proud prīmys
These paītyd popagays that hold up their chin{is}
And loke so smoterly as who say they wold
Have every mā woo them that doth them behold
Tote man for all such venereal work
As good is the foul as the fair in the derk
Thou say true / drafe is good Enough for swine
yet thou answer to no reason of mine
Thy reasons all right well answer I can
For I sey it be cōmeth a noble man
To have rich ap{per}ell &amp; clothing
And goodly housys of costly byldyng
And that ych man according to his degre
Be knowyn from other and what they be
For if such costly thing{is} were not made
work for pore peple could never be hade
And many folk{is} than should fall to Idylnes
which is the moder of vice and wretchydnes
ye but I delight no such vanytese worldly
I delight another in sloth nor gloteny
I dig and delfe &amp; labour for my living
Never ydyll but somewhat ever doing
Daily I ren and go bear sweet &amp; swynk
I ete brown breed and drink small drink
Content with course meat what so ever it be
so it quench the hunger it suffysyth me
These points I use which I have rehersyd now
Be not these gentle conditions I pray you
If thou use them need compellyth the thereto
For if thou coudist hardly thou wold other wise do
what I wold doo then ye can not tell
It is not to purpose but this I wot well
Sith that I use my life in such good manner
whyth such gentle conditions exp̄ssyd here
More than ye both do styll continuing
And sith that gentle conditions is the thing
To make a gentleman the cause principal
wherein I use my life most of vs all
who can by any reason deny than
But that I am of us all most gentleman
In feith if thou be gentleman therefore
Thou art a gentleman agaynt thy will full sore
Sith I se he stādyth in his own cōsait so well
That opinion we shall never expel
From him by no argument nor reason
Therefore now for a little season
Let vs de{per}t from him I hold it best
Then we shall have with him some rest
I agree thereto for cotton saith this
Country verbosas noli cotendere verbis
Contend nor argue never in no matter
with him that is full of words and clatter
wherefore for a season let us both de{per}t
I am agreed thereto with all mine hart
why sirs than will ye de{per}t &amp; be gon
ye that we will farewell for a season
For to tarry here longer we see no great cause
Then fare ye well as wise as two dawys
And I pray god send you such grace both twain
To be stark cockcold{is} or ye come again
Now masters they be both gone away
Therefore one word now hark what I sey
wee see well now by plain ex{per}ience
when a man is set in a wilful credens
All to fortify his own opinion
If god him self than wold with him reason
In effect it shall no more avail
Than with a whip to dryfe a snail
Therefore no remedy is that I can see
For yuell men that be in auctoryte
But let them alone till god will send
A time till our governors may intend
of all enormytes the reformation
And bring in their handis the rod of coreccyon
And the reforming of injuries them self see
And will say p̄cysely thus it shall be
For exortacyons teaching and p̄chyng
Jesting and raylyng they mend no thing
For the amendment of the world is not in me
Nor all the great arguments that we three
Have made sith we resonyd here to gedyr
Do not p̄uayle the weight of a feather
For the helping of any thing that is amiss
we can not help it then sith it so is
I will let the world wagg &amp; home will I goo
And dryf the plough as I was wont to do
And pray god send us peas I will no far mell
Therefore masters all now fare ye well
Now by my troth I am glad that is he gon
And so am I by sweet saint Iohn
I hard not a chorll this seuyn year
Show so cursed reasons as he hath done here
For the maintenance of his opinion
yet he his desseuyd for all his reason
For it is necessary that rulers be
To have posseyons to maintain their degre
And those few to dryfe the multitude all
of the other people to labour to fall
For if the rulers drof them not thereto
The peple wold be ydyll &amp; nothing doo
And most reason is that governance
Should come to such rulers by inheritance
Rather than to have them chose by eleccyon
Oft tymys by dread mede and affection
Men of evil conscience that great tyrants be
Rede old cronyclys the prove ye shall see
And though they have great wit and learning
Yet so proud they be thereof they fere nothing
Another god nor man but evermore styll
with out council or advise follow their own will
But they that by inheritance rulers be
Though they have no great learning yet we see
yet makyth them more fearful &amp; better cōtent
To follow wise men's council and advisement
And sith that yt hath ben so long cōtynned
Inheritors to have rule and so long used
And that they have ruled by as discretion
As the other that have be chose by eleccyon
If that order of rule by succession of blot
Should be dystroyd it should doo hurt &amp; no good
That reason is so great no man can debar
Nevertheless that churlish knave that carter
After his fond opinion thynkyth thus
Himself more gentleman than us
And therein he lies for by expiens we see
That gentle cōdycyons most com̄enly be
In them that be of noble blot borne
For take .xx. carters which never were beforne
Aquayntyd let them be to gyder
Take .xx. strange gentylmen in like manner
These churlish carters I dare well say
will not agree to gyder scant one day
with out chiding quarrelling or fighting
ychone will steal from other and be piking
And strife which of them at the scot shall pay lest
And endeavour them who can play the knave best
But these gentylmen I warrant you will study
who can show to other most courtesy
And of their gentylnes will pfer to pay
For the other and show what pleasurs they may
So touching gentylnes I say surely
Men of great birth use it most com̄ynly
There can be no truer saying nor sentence
And the cause thereof we see by expience
For these pore wretches that have no thing
Must be nygardys churlyth and spayryng
But gentylmen be taught to be liberal
And so they may be for they have where with all
And as touching nobleness that argument
which the ploughmen made late puyth evident
That gentylmen borne to land must needs be
For suffyency of most nobylyte
For beside goddess gifts of grace &amp; of nature
As wit and bodily stryngh yet they be sure
Of other riches as of land and rent
To avoid need so they be more sufficient
of them self than other pore people doubtless
Then if need of strange help cause wrechydnes
And suffysauns be cause wrechydnes
A better reason no man can deuyse
And yet farther I thynk likewise
He that hath great haboundance of riches
May use lyberalyte and gentylnes
And also it is ever necessary
That some life in wealth and some in misery
And let churllys babble and say what they will
Hit hath ben so ever and will be so styll
For it is almighty goddess purueaunce
wise men of follies to have the governance
And they that rule well I beseech Ihesu
Send them good life &amp; long to continue
ye soferayns all discrete &amp; excellent
Before whom this dyalog showed hath be
Touching iii. points by way of argument
First what is gentylnes &amp; what nobylyte
And who should be chose to hye auctoryte
This questions they be so hye and sottell
Few dare p̄sume to dyffyne them well
¶Yet I thynk now under your coreccyons
The thing that makyth a gentleman to be
is but vertew &amp; gentle conditions
which as well in pore men oft tymys we se
As in men of great birth of hye degre
And also vicious churlish cōdycyons
May be in men born to great possessions
¶And forther as touching nobylyte
yet stands much {per}t I thynk doubtless
An sufficiency reason doth agree
But that suffysaunce making nobleness
Must needs he ānexid unto goodness
For suffysauns is not the cause principal
That god his noble but his goodness withal
¶So virtue is ever the thing principal
That gentylnes &amp; nobleness doth ensue
Then these heads rulers &amp; governors all
Should come thereto be cause of their virtue
And in auctoryte they ought not continue
Except they be good men discrete &amp; wise
And have a love &amp; zele unto Justice
¶wherefore souereyns all that here present be
Now mark well these reasons here brought in
Both agayns men of hye &amp; of low degre
For this intent only to rebuke syn
For the best way that is for one to begin
To cōuert the people by exhortation
is to {per}swade them by natural reason
¶For when that a man by his own reason
Jugs himself for to offend
That grudgyth his cōscyens &amp; gyffyth cōpuncyon
Into his heart to cause him amend
But such blind best{is} that will not intend
To here no good council nor reason
Ought by thee law to have sharp coreccyon
¶But then if the laws be not sufficient
which have be made &amp; ordeynyd before
To gyfe there fore cōdygne ponyshment
The princes &amp; governors be bound evermore
To cause new laws to be made therefore
And to put such men in auctocyte
That good men Just &amp; indifferent be
¶But because that men of nature evermore
Be frail &amp; following sensualyte
yt is impossible in a manner therefore
For any gouernouss that be in auctoryte
At all tymys Just &amp; indifferent to be
Except these be brydelyd &amp; thereto compellyd
By some strayt laws for them deuysyd
¶As thus that no man such rome ocupye
But certain yerys &amp; than to be removed
yet that while bound to attend diligently
And if he offend &amp; surely provide
with out any favour that he be ponyhysshyd
For the ponysshment of a Jug or officer
Doth more good than of thousand other
¶And until that such orders be deuysyd
Substauncyally / and put in execution
Loke never to see the world amended
Nor of the great myschefes the reformation
But they that be bound to see the thing{is} done
I pray god of his grace put in their myndys
To reform shortly such things amiss
¶And though that I my self now prase
Thus mine opinion have published
Or any of my fellows hare in this place
In any point here have vs abused
we beseech you to hold vs excused
And so the actor hereof requires you all
And thus I cōmyt you to god eternal.
