SEparting from ye darkened dens
which Ditis low doth keep,
Lo here I am sent out again
from Tartar dungeon ••pe,
Thy•stes I, that whether coast
to shun do stand in doubt,
Thinfernall fe•ndes I fly, the •oalke
of earth I chase about.
My conscience lo abhors, that I
should heth•r passage make,
Appalled sore with fear and dread
my trembling sine w• shake:
My fathers house, or rather yet
my brothers I espy,
This is the old and antique porch•
of Pelops progeny.
Here first the Greeks on p••nces hats
do place the royal crown,
And here in throne aloft they lye,
that lets up and down,
With stately Sceptre in their hand,
eake here their courts do lye,
This is their place of banqueting,
return therefore will I.
Nay: better were it not to haunt
the loathsome Limbo lakes,
Where as the stygion porter doth
advance with lusty crakes
His triple gorge be hong with mane
shag hoary, rusty, black:
Where Ixions carcass linked fa••,
the whirling whele doth rack,
And rolled styll upon him self:
where as full oft in vain
Much toil is lost, (the tottryng stone
down tomblyng back again)
Where growing guts the greedy gripe
do gnaw with ravening bitts.
Where parched up with burning thur••
amid the waives he •ytts,
And gapes to catch the floating flood
with hungry chapps beguiled,
That pays his painful punishment,
whose fea•• the gods defiled:
Yet that old man so step• in years
at length by tract of time,
How great a part belonges to me
and portion of his crime?
Account we all the grisly ghosts,
whom guilty found of ill,
The Gnosian judge in plutoes pits
•oath t•sse in torments styll:
Thyestes I in dryrye deeds
will far surmount the rest,
Yet to my brother yield I, (though
I gorged my bloody breast,
And stuffed have my pawmpred panche
even with my children three,
That crammedly with in my ribs,
and have their tomb in me,
The bowels of my swalowed babes,
devoured up I have,
Nor fickle fortune me alone
the father doth deprave,
But enterprising greater gilt
then that is put in ur,
To fyle my daughters bawdye bed,
my lust she doth allure.
To speak these words I do not spare,
I wrought the heinous dede,
That therefore I through all my stock,
might parent styll proceed.
My daughter driven by force of •a•es
and destinies divine,
Doth breed young bones, &amp; lades her womb,
w• sinful •eede of mine.
Lo nature changed upside down,
and out of order turned
This mingle mangle hath she made,
(O fact to be forlorn••.)
A father and a grandsire lo,
confusedly I am,
My daughters husband both become,
and father to the •am.
Those babes yt should my nephews be,
when nature rightly runs,
She being jumbled doth confound,
and mingle with my sons.
The crystal clearness of the day,
and Phoebus beams so bright,
Are mixed with the foggy clouds,
and darkness dim of night.
When wickedness had wearied vs,
to late truce taken was,
Even when our detestable deeds
were done and brought to pass.
But valiant Agamem•on he
grand captain of the o•te
Who bare the sway among the kings,
and ruled all the roast,
Whose flaunting flag, &amp; banner bra••,
displayed in royal sort,
A thousand sail of sousing ships
did guard to Phrygian port,
And with their swelling shatling s•isles:
the surging seas did hyde,
That heated on the banks of Tree•ye,
and flows •y her side:
When Phoebus cart the Zodiac
ten times had over run,
And wa•te the battered walls do lye
of Troye destroyed and won,
Retournd he is to yield his throat
unto his traitoress wife,
That shall with force of bloody blade
bereave him of his life.
The glittering swerd, the hewing axe,
and wounding weapons mo,
With blood for blood new set a brooch
shall make the floor to flow.
With sturdy stroke, &amp; boysteous blow,
of pithy Pollar given
His beaten brains are poshed abroad,
his cracked skull is reuen.
Now mischief marches on a pace,
Now falshod doth appear,
Now butchers slaughter doth approach,
and murder draws near.
In honour of thy native day
Aegisthus they prepare
The solemn feast with i•n•kiting,
and dainty tothsom fare.
Fie, what doth shame abash thee so,
and cause thy courage quail?
Why doubts thy right hand what to do?
to smite why doth it fail?
What he forecasting might suspect,
why should thou take advise?
Why fret•est thou, demanding if
thou may it enterprise•
Nay: if amother it beseme,
thou rather may surmise.
What now? how happens it that thus
the smiling summers night,
When Phoebus from Thantipodes
should render soon the light,
On sudden chaūg their turns with nights
that last and ling•r lunge,
When winters bore as bitter blasts,
doth puff the trees among?
Or what doth cause the gliding •tarrs
to stay styll in the sky?
We wayght for Phoebus: to the world
bring day now by and by.
O Fortune, that dost fail
the great estate of kings,
on slippery sliding seat
thou placest lofty things
And sit•t on tottring sort,
where perils do abound
yet never kingdom calm,
nor quiet could be found:
No day to scepters sure,
doth shyne, that they might say,
To morrow shall we rule,
as we have don to day.
One clod of crooked care
another brings in,
One hurly burly done,
another doth begin:
Not so the raging sea
doth boyle upon the sand,
Where as the southern wind
that blows in Africa land,
One wave upon another
doth heap with sturdy blast:
Not so doth Euxine sea,
his swelling waives up cast:
Nor so his belching stream
from shallow bottom roll,
That borders hard upon
the icy frozen pool:
Where as Boots bright
doth twyne his wayne about,
And of the marble seas
doth nothing stand in doubt.
O how doth fortune toss
and tomble in her whele
The staggring states of kings,
that reddy be to rele?
Fey•e wold they dreded be,
and yet not settled so
When as they feared are,
they fear and live in woe.
The sylent Lady night
so sweet to man and beast,
Can not bestow on them
h•r safe and quiet rest:
Sleep that doth overcome
and break the bond•s of grief,
I cannot ease their har•es,
nor minister relief:
What castle strongly built,
what Bulwark, tower, or town,
Is not by mischiefs means,
brought topsy tur•ey down?
What rampart walls are not
made weak by wicked war?
From stately courts of kings
doth justice fly afar:
In princely palaces,
of honesty the lore,
And wedlock now devout,
is set by little store.
The bloody Bellon th•se
doth ha•ned with gory hand,
Whose light and vain conceit
in painted pomp doth stand.
And those Erinnys wood
turmoils with frenzies fits,
That ever more in proud
and haughty houses sitts,
Which fycle fortunes hand
in twinkling of an eye,
From high and proud degre
drives down in dust to lye.
Although that skirmish •eace,
no banners be displayed
And though no wiles be wrought
and policy be stayed,
Down poised with their wayght
the massy things do sink,
And from her burden doth
unstable fortune shrink.
The swelling Sails pu•t up
with gale of western wind,
Do yet mistrust thereof
a tempest in their mind:
The threatening tops (that touche
the clouds) of lofty towers
Be soonest paid and bett
with south wind rainy showers:
The darksome wood doth see
his tough and sturdy Ok,
Well waynd in years to be
clean overthrown and broke:
The lightnings flashing flame
out breaking in the sky,
First lights on the mounts,
and hills that are most hye.
The bodies corpule•t
and of the largest seize
Are rifest styll to catch
deseases when they rise.
When as the flock to g•as,
in pasture fat is putt,
Whose neck is larded best,
his throat shall first be cut:
What f•rtune doth advance,
and hoists up on hy•,
She setes it up to fall
again more grievously.
The things of middle sort,
and of a mean degree,
Endure aboue the rest
and longest days do see:
The man of mean estate
most happy is of all,
Who pleased with the lot
that doth to him befall,
Doth sail on sylent shore.
with calm and quiet tide,
And dreads with bruised barge
on swelling seas to ride:
Nor lawncyng to the deep
where bottom none is found,
may with his rudder search,
and reach the shallow ground.
O Drowsy dreaming dotyng soul,
what comes in thy brain,
To seek about for thy defence
what way thou may attain?
What aiels thy skittish wayward wits,
to waver up and down?
The fittest shift prevented is,
the best path overgrown:
Thou might once maintained have
thy wedl•ck chamber chaste,
And eak have ruled with majesty,
by faith conjoined fast:
Now nurtures lore neglected is,
all right doth clean decay,
Religion and dignity
with faith are worn away:
And ruddy sha•e with blushing cheeks
so far god •ot is past,
That when it would it cannot now
com home again at last.
O let me now at random run
with bridle at my will:
The safest path to mischief is
by mischief open styll.
Now put in practyss•, seek about,
search out and learn to find
The wily trains, and crafty guiles
of wicked woman kind:
What any devilish tray•erous dame
durst do in working woe,
Or any wounded in her wits
by shot of Cupids bow:
What ever rigorous stepdame could
committ with desperate hand,
Or as the wench who flaming fast
by Venus poisoning brand,
Was driven by lewd vncesteous love
in ship of thessail land,
To flit away from Cholchos Isle,
where Ph•sis channel deep
With silver stream down from y• hills
of Armenie doth swepe.
Get weapons good, get bilbow blades,
or temper poison strong,
Or with some yonker trudge frō Greece
by theft the seas along:
Why dost thou faint to talk of theft,
exile, or privy flight?
These came by hap: thou therefore must
on greater myschife light.
¶(O worthy queen) among ye Greeks
that bears the swinging •way
And borne of Ledas royal blood,
what mut•r•ng dost thou say•?
What fury fell enforces the,
bereaved of thy wits,
To rage &amp; rave with bedlam brains,
to fret with frantic fits?
Though madam thou do counsel keep,
and not complain thy case,
Thine anguish plain appears in
thy pale and winnie face:
Reueal therefore what is thy grefe,
take leisure good and staye,
What reason could not remedy,
oft eured hath delay.
¶So grievous is my careful case
which plun•eth me so sore•
That deal I cannot with delay,
nor linger •ny more.
The flashing flames, and furious force
of fyrye fervent heat,
Outraging in my boiling breast,
my burning bones doth beat:
It sucks the sappye marowe out,
the joyce it doth convey,
It frets, it tears, it rents, it gnaws,
my guts and gall away.
Now feeble fear still eggs me on
(with dolor being pressed)
And cankered hate with thwacking thumps
doth bounce upon my breast:
The blinded boy that lovers hearts
doth reave with deadly stroke,
Entangled hath my linked mind
with lewd and wanton yoke:
Refusing styll to take afoyle,
or clean to be confound,
Among these broils, and agonies
my mind besegyng round,
Lo feeble, weary• battered down,
and under trodden shame,
That wrested, strives, strugleth hard,
and fights with the same.
Thus am I driven to divers shores,
and beat from bank to bank•,
And tossed in the fomye floods,
that strive with courage crancke.
As when here wind, &amp; there ye stream
when both their force will try,
From sands allow, doth hoist &amp; rear
the seas with surges hye,
The weltering wave doth staggrynge stand,
not wetyng what to doe,
But (hovering) doubts, whose furious force
he best may yield him to.
My kingdom therefore I cast of,
my sceptre I •orsake
As anger, sorrow, hope, me lead,
that way I mean to take.
At all adventure to the seas
I yield my beten Barge,
At random careless will I ron,
now will I rove at large.
Where as my mind to fancy fond
doth gad, and ron astray,
It is the best to choose that chance,
and follow on that way.
¶This desperate dotage doth declare,
and rashness rude and blind,
To choose out chance to be the guide
and ruler of thy mind.
¶He that is driven to utter pinch,
and furthest shift of all,
What neade he doubt his doubtful lot,
or how his luck be fall?
In sylent shore thou saylest yet,
thy trespass we may hyde,
If thou thy self detect it not,
nor cause it be dyscryde.
¶Alas it is more blasd abroad,
and further is it blown,
Then any crime that ever in
this princely court was sown.
¶Thy former fault with pensive heart
and sorrow thou dost few,
And fondly yet thou goosed about,
to set abroche anew,
¶It is auery folyshnes
to keep a mean therein,
¶The thing he fears he doth augmēt,
who heaps syn to syn.
¶But fire &amp; sword to cure the same,
the place of salve supply.
¶There is no man who at the first
extremity will try.
¶In working mischief men do take
the readiest way they find.
¶The sacred name of wedlock once
revoke and have in mind,
¶Ten years have I bin desolate,
and led a widows life.
Yet shalt I enter•ay•e anew
my husband as his wife?
¶Consydor yet thy son and ha••e
whom he of the begot•
¶And eke my daughters wedding blase
as yet forget I not.
Achilles eke my son in law
to mind I do not spare,
Howe well he kept his vow that he
to me his mother swear.
¶When as our nauye might not pass
by wind, nor yet by stream,
Thy daughters blood in sacrifice
their passage did redeem:
She stirred and brake the sluggish seas,
whose water styll did stand,
Whose feeble force might not hoise up,
the vessels from the land.
¶ I am ashamed herewith all,
it makes me rapine,
That Tyndaris (who from the gods
doth fetch her noble lygne)
Should give the ghost tasswage ye wrath
of gods and them appease,
Whereby the grekyshe nauye might
have passage free by seas.
My grudging mind styll harps upon
my daughters wedding day,
Whom he hath made for Pelops stock
the bloody ransom paye.
When as with cruel countenance
embrewd with gory blood,
As at a wedding alter side
thunpy•yfull parent stood,
It erk•d Calchas woeful heart,
who did abhor the same,
His Oracle he rowed, and eake
the back reflyctyng flame.
O wicked and ungracious stock
that winnest ill with ill,
Triumphing in thy filthy feats,
increasing lewdness styll.
By blood we win ye wavering winds,
By death we purchase war.
¶But by this means a thousand ships
at once released are:
¶With lucky fate attempt the seas
did not the lost rowt?
For Aulis Isle, thungracious flete,
from port did tumble out:
As with aloud unlucky hand
the war he did begin,
So fortune favoured his su•ces
to thryue nomore therein.
Her love as capty•e holds him
whom captive he did take.
Not moved with the ernest suit
that could Achilles make,
Of Phoebus prelate Sminthicall
he did retain the spoil:
When for the sacred virgins love
his furious breast doth boyle:
Achilles rough and thundering threats
could not him •ualyfye,
Nor he that doth dir••t the fa•es
aboue the starry sky.
To vs he is an Augur just,
and kepes his promise dew•
But while he threats his captive truls
of word he is not tree•w.
The savage people fearce in wrath
once might not move his spright,
Who did purloin the kindled tents
with fire blasyng bright:
When slaughter great on Greeks was made
in most extremest fight
Without a foe he conquered.
with leanes pines away
In lewd and wanton chamber tricks
he spends the idle day,
And freshly 〈◊〉 he •e•des his lust,
least that some other while
His chamber chaste should wāt a stews,
that might the •am defile.
On Lady Brises love again
his faneye fond doth stand,
Whom he hath got, tha• wrested was
out of Achilles hand.
And carnal copulation
to have he doth not shame,,
Though from her husbands bosom he
hath snatched the wicked dame,
Tush, he that doth at Paris grudge,
With wound but newly stroke
Eflamd with Phrygian Prophets love,
his boiling breast doth smoke.
Now after Trojan boties brave,
and Troy ouerwhelmd he saw,
Retournd he is a prisoners spouse,
and Priams son in law.
Now hart be bold, take courage good,
of stomach now bestowed,
A field that easily is not fought,
to pitch thou goosed about.
In practise myschife thou must put,
why hopste thou for a day,
While Priams daughter com from Troy
in Greece do bear the swaye?
But as for the poor sly wretch,
a wayteth at thy place
Thy widow, virgins, and Orest
his fatherlyke in face,
Consider their calamities,
to com, and eake their cares,
Whom all the peril of the broil
doth threat in thy affairs.
O cursed captive, woeful wretch,
why doest thou loiter so?
Thy little brats a stepdame have,
whose wrath will work their wo.
With gashing swerd (and if thou can
none other way provide)
Nor thrust it through an •theirs ribs,
then launch thy gory side.
So murder twain with brew•d blood,
let blood immixed be,
And by destroying of thy self
destroy thy spouse with thee.
Death is not saw with sops of sorrow
if some man else I have,
Whose breathl•sse corse I wish to pass
with me to deadly grave.
¶Queen, bridle thine affections,
and wisely rule ••y rage,
Thy swelling mood now myt•igate,
thy chollure eke assuage.
Way well the weighty enterprise
that thou doest take in hand,
Triumphant victor be retournes
of mighty Asia land
Avenging Europs injury,
with him he brings away
The spoils of sacked Pargamie,
a huge and mighty pray.
In bondage eake he leads the foalke
of long assaulted Troy•,
Yet dare thou by policy
attempt him to annoy?
Whom with the dynt of glittering swerd
Achilles durst not harm,
Although his rash and desperate dick•
The froward knight did arm•
Nor Aiax yet more hardy man
up yielding vital breath,
Whom frantic jury fell enforced
to wound him self to death:
Nor Hector, he, whose only life
procuerd the Greeks delay,
And long in war for victory
enforced them to staye
Nor Paris shaft, whose conning hand
with shot so sure did aim:
Nor mighty Memnon answered and black,
had power to hurt the same:
Nor Xan•hus flood, where to and fro
dead ca•kasis did swim,
With armour hewd and there with all
some maimed broken lyme:
Nor Simois, that purple wawmes
with slaughter died doth steer.
Nor Cygnus Lylly whyght, the son•
of fenny god so dear:
Nor yet the mu•teryng Thracian host:
nor warlike Re•suss king:
Nor Amazons, who to the wars
did painted Quivers bring,
And bare their har•hets in their hands,
with target, and with shield,
Yet had no power with ghastly wound
to foil him in the feylde.
Sith he such scourynges hath escaped,
and plunge of perils paste,
Intend thou to murder him,
returning home at last?
And sacred alters to profane
with slaughter so v••ur?
Shall Greece thaduenger, let this wrong
lunge unrevenged endure?
The g•ym and fearce coragious horse,
the battles shou•es and cries,
The swelling seas which brus•d barks
do dread, when storms arise,
Behold the fields with streams of blood
overflown and deeply dro••d,
And all the Chivalry of Troy
in servile bondage bound,
Which Greeks have writ in registers.
thy stubburne stomach bind,
Subdue thy •onde affections,
and pacify thy mind•.
THe cursed time that evermore
my mind did most detest,
The dais that I abhorred have
and hated in my breast,
Are come, are come, that mine estate
will bring to utter wrack:
Alas my heart, why doest thou fail,
and fainting fliest back?
What doest thou mean at first assault•
from armour thus to fly?
Trust this, the cruel gods intend•
thy dolfull destiny,
To wrap thee in with perils round,
and catch thee in a band:
Endeavour drudge with all thy power
their plagues for to withstand:
With stomach stout rebellious,
to fire and swerd appeal.
¶It is no plague, if such a death
thy native destnies deal.
¶(O partners of my perils all,
begot of Leda thou)
Direct thy doings a•la mine,
and unto thee I vow,
This drosell, fluggysh ringleader,
this stout strong har•ed •ire,
Shall pay the so much blo•d again
as shed he hath in fire.
How haps it that his trēbling cheeks
to be so pale and whyght,
Lying aghast, as in a trance,
with fainting face upright?
¶His cōsciēce wedlo•k vow doth prick
and brings him home again.
Let vs return the self same •rade
a new for to retain,
To which at first we should have stuck
and ought not to forsake,
To covenant continent a new
let vs our selves betake:
To take the trade of honesty
at no time is to late:
He purged is from punishment
whose heart the crime doth hate.
¶Why whether wilt thou gad (o rash
and unadvised dame?)
What doest thou earnestly believe,
and firmly trust the same,
That Agamemnons spousal bed
will loyal be to thee,
That nought doth underprop thy mind
which might thy terror bee?
His proud success puffed up to high
wi•h lucky blast of wind,
Might make so crank, and set aloft
his haughty swelling mind:
Among his pears he stately was,
er Trojan turrets torn,
How •hynk ye then his stomach stout
by nature given to scorn,
In haughtiness agmented is
more in him self to joy,
Through this triumphant victory
and conquest got of Troye?
Before his voyage miceane king
most myl•lie did he reign,
But now a Tyrant truculent
returned he is again.
Good luck and proud prosperity
do make his heart so rise.
With what great preparation
prepared solemn wise,
A rabblement of strumpets come
that clonge about him all?
But yet the prophetess of Phoebe,
(whom god of truth we call)
Appears aboue the rest: she kepes
the king, she doth him guide:
Will• thou in wedlock have a mate
and not for it provide?
So would not she, the great•st grief
this is unto a wit,
Her husbands minion in her house
to lead an open life.
A queens estate can not abide
her pear with her to reign,
And Jealous wedlock will not her
companion sustain.
¶Jig•st in desprat mode again
why se•st thou me a flote?
Why kyndlest thou the sparks of ire
in embers covered hot?
If that the victors own free will
releas his captives care,
Why may not I his lady spouse
have hope as well to fare?
One law doth rule in royal throne,
and pompous princely towers,
Among the vulgar sort, another
in private simple bowers.
what though my grudging fancy force
that at my husbands hand,
Sharpe execution of the law
I s•ubbernly withstand?
•ecordyng this that heinous•ye
offended him I have:
•gently will me pardon grant
who need the same to crave?
¶Even so? on this condition
thou may with him compound,
To pardon him, if he again
to pardon thee be bound.
The subtle science of the law,
The statutes of our land,
(That lunge ago decreed were)
thou doest not understand.
The Judges be malicious men,
they spy•hte and envy vs,
But he shall have them partial
his causes to dyscns.
This is the chiefest privilege
that doth to kings belong,
What laws forbids other men
they do, and do no wrong.

Which Europe all, with Asia

Suppose thou nothing hast cōmyt•

What •oteth him whom princes hate
an honest life to frame?
He never doth complain his wrong,
but ever bears the blame.
Will thou repair to Spart, and to
thy country trudge aright?
Will thou become a ronagate,
from such a worthy wight?
Divorcement made from kings, will not
so let the matter scope,
Thou easest fear, by fickle hope,
that falsely thou doest shape:
¶My trespass is disclosed to none,
but to a trusty wight.
¶At princes gates fidelity
yet never enter might.
¶I will corrupt and fe•de him s•
with silver and with gould,
That I by bribing bind him shall
no secrets to unfold:
¶The trust that hired is and bought
by bribes and moneys fee,
Thy counsel to bewray a gain
with bribes enticed will bee,
¶The remnant left of shamfa•nes
of those ungracious •ryckes,
Wherein of late I did delight,
my concience freshly pricks.
Why kepest thou such a busy stir,
and with thy flattering speech
Enst rusting me with lewd advise
dost wicked counsel preach?
Shall I forsooth of royal blood
with all the speed I can,
Refuse the king of kings, and wed
an outcast banished man?
¶Why should you think in that Thyest
was father unto me,
And Agamemnon Atreus son
he should my better be?
¶If that be but a trifle small
Ad Nephew to the same,
¶I am of Phoebus linage borne,
whereof I do not shame.
Why makste thou Phoebus author of
thy wicked pedagrew,
Whom out of heaven ye forced to fly
when bridle back he drew?
When lady night with mantle black
did spread her sudden shade,
Why make thou the gods till such
reproach fulness to wade?
Whose father hath thee conning made
by fleyght and subtle guile
To make thy kinsman Cockold, while
his wife thou do defile.
What man is he whom we do know
to be thy fathers mate,
Abusing lust of lechery
in such unlawful rate?
Avaunt, go pack the hence in ha••e,
dispatch, out of my sight
This infamy, whose blemish stains
this blood of worthy wight.
¶This is no new exile to me
that wickedness do haunt,
But if that thou (o worthy queen)
command me to a•aunt
I will not only straight avoid
the house, the town, and field,
My life on swerd at thy request
I ready am to yield.
¶This heinous dede permit shall I
(most churlish cruel drab)
Against my will though I offend,
the fault I should not blab:
Nay, rather come apart with me,
and let vs join our wits,
To wrap our selves out of this wo,
and parlous threatening fits.
NOw chant it lusty lads.
Apollos praise suborn,
To thee the frolic flock

Their savoury garlands greene

Whereas the Laurel tree

Eke ye whom Man do mild,

Hath stirred to celebrate

Appollo and Dian

O victor Phoebe vnbend
thy nocked •owe again,
Sith quietness and peace
anew we do retain.
And let thy twāckling harp
make melody so sh•ill,
While that thy nimble hand
strike quauers with thy quill.
No curious descant I
nor lus•ie music cr•ue,
No jolly rumbling note,
nor trowlyng tune to have.
But on thy treble Lute
(according to thy use)
St•yke up a plain song note,
as when thy learned Muse
Thy lessons do record,
though yet on baser string
It likes thee to play
the songe that thou did singe:
As when from fyry heaven
the dynt of lightning flew,
Sent down by wrath of gods,
the Titans overthrew.
Or else when moūtains were
on mountains heaped hye
That raise for G•aunts fell
their steppes into the sky,
The mountain Ossa stood
on top of Pelion laid,
Olymp (whereon the Pines
their buddyng branches brayd)
Down poised both: draw ne'er
o June• noble dame,
Both spouse of mighty Jove
and sister to the same:
Thou that doest r•le with him
made jointer of his mace,
Thy people we of Greece
give •onour to thy grace:
Thou only dost protect
from perils Argos land,
That ever careful was
to have thine honour stand,
(Most suppliant there unto)
thou also with thy might
Dost order joyful peace
and battles fearce of fight,
Accept o conquering queen
these branches of the bays,
That Agamemnon here
doth yield unto thy praise:
The hollow boxen pipe
(that doth with holes abound)
In syngyng unto thee
doth give a solemn sound:
To thee the damsels ek•
that play upon the strings,
With conning harmony
m•lodious music synges.
The ma•rons eke of Gr•c•
by ryper years more grave,
To thee the •appear paye,
that vowed oft they have,
The beyferd young &amp; whit•
companion of the Full
Unskilful, yet by proof
the painful pl•in to pull,
whose neck was never worn•
nor gald with prynt of yoke,
Is in thy temple slain
receiving deadly stroke.
O laid Pallas thou
of mo•t renoumned hap
Bred of the brain of Jove
that smites with thonder clap.
Thou lofty Trojan •owres
of craggy knotty flint
Hast bet with battryng blade,
and struck with iauelyng din••
The elder matrons with
the dames that younger be
Together in mingled heaps
do hono•r due to thee.
when tho• approaching nigh
thy coming is espied,
The priest vnbarrs the gate
and ops the Temple wide:
By clustering thronges the flocks
thine altars haunt apace,
Bedecte with twisted crowns
so trym with comely grace.
The old and ancient men
well stepped and grown in years,
Whose feeble trembling age
precureth horye hear•s,
Obtaining their request
craved of thy grace divine,
Do offer up to thee
their sacrificed wine,
O bright Dian whose blase
sheds light three sundry ways,
We mine•full are of thee,
and render thankful praise,
Delon thy native soil
thou did firmly bind,
That to and fro was wont
to wander with the wind:
Which with foundation sure
mayn ground for bid• to pass:
For Navies (after which
to swim it wonted was)
It is become a Road
defying force of wind,
The mothers funerals
of Tantalus his kind.
The daughters seven by death
thou victresse doest account,
Whose mother Niobe
abides on Sipill mount
A lamentable rock,
and yet unto this hour
Her tears new gushing, out
the marble old doth power.
The godhood of the twins
in sumpteous solemn wise,
Both man and wife adore
with savoury sacrifice.
But thee aboue the rest,
o father great and guide,
Whose mighty force is b•
the burning lightning tried•
Who whē thou gave a beek
and did thy head but shake,
At once the•tremest pools
of heaven and earth did quake.
O Iupiter the rote
that of our lynage art,
Accept these offered gifts
and take them in good part:
And thou o grandsire great
•o thy posterity
Have some remorse, that do
not sworn in chyual•ye.
But yonder •o with stiuing steps
the soldi•r comes a mayne
In all post hast, with token that
good news declares plain
A laurel branch, that hangs on
his spear head he doth bring:
Eurybates is come, who hath
ben trusty to the king.
SOre tyred after many years
with travail &amp; with toil
Scant crediting my self, the Gods
of this my native soil,
The temple, and the alters of
the saints that rule the sky,
In humble sort with reverence
devoutly worship I.
Now pay your vows unto the Gods:
returned is again
Unto his country•y court, where wont
he was to rule, and reign,
Prince Agamemnon, victor he,
of Greece the great r•n•um•.
¶The tidings of a message good
unto mine ears is blown.
Where stays my spouse whō longing for
ten years I have out scand?
What doth he yet sail on the seas,
or is he come a land?
Yet hath he fixed and set his foot
back stepping home again
Upon the sandy shore, that lunge
he wished to artayne?
And doth he still enjoy his health
enhance•e in glory great,
And painted out in pomp of prays
whose fame the sky doth beat?
¶Bless we with burning sacrifice,
at length this lucky day.
¶ And eke the gods though gracious
Yet dealing long delay:
Declare if that my brothers wife
enjoy the vital ayre,
And tel me, to what kind of Coast
my sister doth repair.
¶God grant &amp; give vs better news
then this that thou doest crave:
The heavy hap of fighting floods
•orbyddes the truth to have.
Our scat•red fleet the swelling seas
attempts in such a plight,
That ship from ship was taken clean
out of eche others sight.
Atrides in the waters wide
turmoyld and straying far,
More violence by seas sustained
then by the bloody war.
And as it were a conquered man
escaping home all weet
Now brings in his company
of such a mighty fleet,
A sort of bruised broken barks,
beshaken, torn, and rent.
¶Show what unlucky chance it is
that hath our Nauye spent,
What storm of seas dispersed hath
our Captains hear and theare?
¶Thou willest me to make report
of heavy woeful gear.
Thou bid me most grievous news
with tidings good to part:
For uttering of this woeful hap
my feeble mind doth start.
And horribly appalled is
with this so monstrous ill.
¶Speak out, and utter it: him self
with terror he doth fill,
Whose heart his own calamity
and cark, doth loathe to know:
The heart whom doubted damage dulls
with greater grief doth glow.
¶Whē Trojan buildings blazing bright
did burn away, and broil,
Kindled first by Grekish brand,
they fall to part the spoil:
Repairing fast unto the seas
again we come a board,
And now the soldiers weary loins
were eased of his sword,
Their bucklers cast aside upon
the hatches lie aboue:
Their warlike hands in practise put,
and Oars learn to move:
Eche little hyndraunce seems to much
to them in hasty plight,
When of recourse the Admiral,
gave watchword by his light,
And trumpet blast began to call
our army from delay,
The painted Pup with gilded snout
did first guide on the way:
And cut the course, which foal•ing on
a thousand ships did rive,
Then first a wind with p•pling puffs
our lancing ships did drive:
Which glided down upon our sails:
the water being calm
With breath of western wind so mild
scant moved any walme.
The shining seas bespred about
with ships, doth glitter bright,
And also covered with the same,
lay hyd fro Phoebus light:
It doth vs good, to case upon
the nak•d shore of Troy:
The desert Phrygian plots so bar•
to view, we hop for joy:
The youth echone besturrs thē selves,
and striking altogether
They tough their ores, &amp; with their toil•
they help the wind and weather.
They tug, and cheerly row by course,
the spyrtyng seas up dash,
Against the rattling ribs of ships
The flapping floods do flash•
The hory froth of wrestling waives
which ores aloe•t doth raise,
Do draw and trace a furrow through
the marble faced seas.
When strōger blast with belly swollen
our hoisted sails did fill,
They row no more, but let the Pup
to go with wind at will,
Their sheryng Ore• laid aside
our Pilot doth espy,
How far from any land aloof
our sails reculyng fly.
Or bloody battles doth display,
the threats of Hector stout,
Or of his rattling Waggins tells,
wherein he rode about:
Or how his gashed carckas slain
and trained about the fylde,
To funeral flames, and obit rights
for coin again was yield.
How Iupiter embathed was
all in his royal blood.
The frolic fyshe disposed was
to mirth in Tyrant flood,
And fetching fryskes both in and out
plays on the waters brim,
And on his broad and finny back•
about the seas doth swim,
With gambols quick in rings aroūd,
and side to side inclined,
Erwhyle he sports afront the pup,
and whips again behind,
Now fiddling on the snout before,
the dalyeng wanton rowt
With iocundarye jolly tricks
doth skip the flete about.
Sometime he stands gasyng on
and eyes the vessels bright,
Now every shore is covered clean,
and land is out of sight,
The parlous point of Ida rock
in sight doth open lye,
And that alone espy we could
with firm•lie fixed eye,
A dusky cloud of sty•ling smoke
from Troy did smolter black,
When Titan from the weary necks
the heavy yokes did slack.
The fading light did grovelling bend,
and down the day did shroud,
Against the stars amounting up
a little misty cloud,
Came belching out in irksome lompe,
and Phoebus gallant beams
He spout upon, bestayning them
duet down in western streams.
The Sun set swaruyng in such sort
with divers change of face
Did give vs cause, to have mistrust
of Neptunes doubted grace.
The evening first did bun•nish bright,
and paint with stars the sky,
The winds were laid, &amp; clean forsook
our sails, that quiet lye.
whē cracking, rattling, rumbling noise,
rushed down wi•h thundering swaye
From top of hills, which greater stir
doth threaten and bewray.
With belowinges, &amp; yellynges loud,
the shores do grunt an• groan,
The craggy clyues, &amp; roaring rocks,
do howl in hollow stone.
The bubbling wa•ers swells vpreard
before the wrestling wind,
When suddenly the lowryng light
of moon is hid and blind.
The glymsyng stars do go to glade,
the surging seas are tossed
Even to the skies, among the cloud•
the light of heaven is lost•
More nights in one compacted are,
with shadow dim and black,
One shade upon another doth
more darkness heap• and pack,
And every spark of light consumed
the waives and skies do mete.
The ruflyng winds range on the seas•
through every coast they •lytt.
They heave it up with violence.
ouerturnd from bottom low,
The western wind flat in the face
of eastern wind doth blow.
With hurly burly Bores
set op his blasting mouth,
And gyroeth out his boysteous breath,
against the stormy south,
Each wind with all his might doth blow,
and works dangers deep,
They shake the floods, a sturdy blast
along the seas doth swepe.
That rolls, &amp; •ūbles wave on wave,
a northern tempest strong
Abundance great of flackye snow•
doth hurl our ships among.
The south wind out of Lybia
doth rage upon a should,
And with the puissant force thereof
the quick sands up be rolled,
Nor bids in the south, which doth
with tempest lump and lower,
And force the flowing floods to rise
by pouring out a shower.
The stubborn E•r•s earthquakes made,
and shoke the countries eas•,
And E•s cost, where Phoebus first
arises from his test.
How violent Corus stretched and tare
his yawning mouth •ull wide?
A man wold sure have thought y• world
did from his center flied,
And that the frames of heaven broke •p
the gods down wold fall,
And Chaos dark confused heap
wold shade and cover all.
The stream strove with the wind, y• wind
did beat it back again,
The springing sea within his banks
can not it self contain,
The raging shower his trilling drops
doth mingle with the seas,
And yet in all this misery
they find not so much eas,
To see and know what ill• it is,
that works their decay.
The darkness dim oppresses styll
and kepes the light away:
The black facst night with hellicke hew
was clad of stygian lake
And yet full oft with glimsyng beams
the sparkling fire out brake.
The cloud doth crack, and being rent
the lightning leaps out,
The wretches like the same so well
it shining them about,
That still they wysh such light to hau•.
(although god wo• but ill)
The navy swaying down it self
doth cast away, and spyll.
One side with other side is cracked,
and helm is rent with helm,
The ship it self the gulping seas
do headlong over whelm.
Erwhyle a grydie gaping gulf
doth sup it up amain,
Then by an by tossed up aloft
it spewes it out again,
She with her swaggyng full of sea
to bottom low doth sink,
And drenches deep aside in floods
her tottryng broken brink.
That underneath a dozen waives
lay drowned out of sight,
Her broken planks swim up &amp; down,
spoiled is her tackle quite,
Both sail and Ores clean are lest,
the mayn mast cake is gon.
That wonted was to bea•e upright
the sail yard thereupon,
The timber and the broken bordes
lye on the waters brim,
When cold &amp; shivering fear in vs
doth strike through every lym•
The wisest wy•ts entocksycate
dare nothing enterprise,
And conning practise nought avail•,
When fearful storms arise,
The mariners letting duty slyppe
stand staring al aghast,
Their scooping ores suddenly
out of their hands are wrast.
To prayer then apace we fall,
when others hope is none,
The Greeks &amp; Troyans to the Gods
alike do make their moan.
Alack what succour of the fates
may we poor wretches find?
Against his father Pyrrhus bears
a spiteful cankered •inde,
At Aiax grudge Vlysses doth,
king Menela doth hate
Great Hector: Agamemnon is
with Priam at debate.
O happy man is he, that doth
lye slain in Trojan ground,
And hath deserved by handy stroke,
to take his fatal wound,
Whom fame preserves, taking up
his tomb in conquered land.
Those moms whose melting cowards hart
durst never take in hand,
Or enterprise no noble act,
those force of floods shall drown,
But fate forbearing long, will take
stout brutes of high rename,
Full well we may ashamed be,
in such a sort to dye,
If any man his spiteful mind
yet can not satisfy,
with these ou•ragious plūging plages
That down from gods are sent,
Appease at length thy wrathful god
again, and eke relent.
Even Troy for pity wold have wept,
to see our woeful case,
But if that in thy boiling breast
black rancour styll have place,
And that the Greeks to ruin run,
it be thy purpose bent,
Why do these Troyans go to wrack?
for whom thus are we spent?
Assuage the rigour of the sea
that threa•nyng hills up reares:
This drenched fleet the Trojan folk
and Greeks together bears.
Then from their prayers are they put,
their foultryng tongues do stay,
the roaring seas doth drown their voice
and cares their cries away.
Then mighty Pallas armed with
the leppyng lightning fire,
That testy Jove doth use to hurl
provoked to swelling ire,
With threatening Iaueling in her hand,
her prow• means to try,
And eke her force whose boiling breast
with Gorgon• fits doth fry,
Or what with target she can do,
and with her fathers fire.
Then from the skies another storm
begins abroad to spyre,
But Aiax nothing yet dismayed
all force withstands stout,
whō when he spread his swelling sails
with cable stretched out,
She lighting down did wring him hard,
&amp; wrapped him in her ••am,
And flange another flashing dint
of lightning on the same,
With all her force and violence
her h•nd brought back again,
She tossed him out, as late that feat
her •ather tought her plain.
Both over Aiax and his Pup
she slyeth overthwart,
And renting man and ship, of both
she bears away a part,
His courage nought abated yet
he al to syngde doth •eme,
Even like a stubborn ragged rock
amid the striving stream,
He trains along the roaring seas
and eke the weltering wave
By shouyng on his bourly breast
in sonder quyte he drove,
The Bark with hand he caught, &amp; on
it self did type it over,
Yet Aiax shines in the flood
which darkness blind doth cover.
At length attaining to a rock
his thundering crakes were these,
I conquered have the force of fire
and rage of fighting seas,
It doth me good, to master thus
the anger of the sky,
with Pallas wrath, the lightning flames
and floods tumulting hye.
The terror of the warlike god
once could not make me fly,
The force of Mars and Hector both
at once sustained have I.
Nor Phoebus darts could me cōstrayne,
from him one foot to shoon,
All these beside the Phrygians
subdued we have, and won:
when other Mecocks flings his darts
shall I not them withstand?
Yea, what if Phoebus came him self,
to pitch them with his hand?
When in his melancholy mood
He boasted without mean.
Then father Neptune lift his head
aboue the waters clean.
The beaten rock with forked mace
he undermining plucked
From bottom loose, &amp; sunk it down,
when down him self he duckte.
Theare Aiax lay, by land, by sire,
and storm of seas destroyed,
But we by suffering shipwreck, are
with greater plagues anoyd.
A subtle shallow flood thear is
flown on a stony should,
Where crafty Caphar out of sight
the lurking rocks doth hold,
Upon whose sharpe and ragged top•
the swelling tide doth flow,
The boiling waives do beat thereon
styll sweaing to and fro:
A turret nodding over it
doth hang with falling swaye,
From whence on either side frō height
prospect espy we may
Two seas: and on this hand the coast
where P•lops once did reign,
And Istmus flood in narrow creek,
reculyng back again,
Doth stop Ionian sea, lest in
to Hellespont it run,
On tother part is Lemnon flood
that fame by blodshed won.
On tother side Calcedon town
doth stand against this forte,
A•d Aulis Isle that stayed our shyps
that thither did resort.
This Castle here inhabit doth
our Palimedes sier,
Whose cursed hand held in the top
a brand o• flaming fire,
That did allure our fleet, to turn
on lurking rocks a right,
Enticing them with wily blase
to come unto the light.
All into fitters shaken are
the ve•sells on the should,
But other some do swim, and some
upon the rocks are roulde.
And other slyppyng back again•
so to eschew the rocks,
His bruised ribs and rattling sides
against each other knocks,
Whereby the other he doth brea•e,
and broken is him self,
Then would they lance int• the deep,
for now they dr•ad the shelf,
This peck of •roubles chaun•t to hap
in dawning of the day.
But when the Gods (besought of vs)
began the rage to staye,
And Phoebus golden beams began
a fresh to render light,
The dolfull day dys•riot all
the damage done by night.
¶O whether may I now lame•t,
and weep with wailing sad,
Or shall I else in that my spouse
returned is be glad?
I do rejoice, and yet I am
compelled to bewail
My countries great calamity
that doth the same assail.
O father great whose majesty
doth thundering sep•ers shake,
The lowryng Gods unto the Gr•kes
now favourable make,
With garlands greene let every head
rejoicing now be cround.
To to thee the pipe in sacrifice
m•lodiously doth sound,
And on thine alter lies slain
an Heyferdlyly white,
Before the same do present stand
with hanging lockes vndyght,
A car•full Trojan company
in heavy woeful plight,
On whom frō heygh the Laurel tree
with spredding branch doth shyne,
Whose virtue hath inspired them
with Phoebus grace divine,
ALas the cruel sting of love
how sweetly doth it taste,
A misery to mortal man
annexed while life doth last?
The path of mischief for to fly,
now sith there is a gap,
And wretched souls be frankly called
from every woeful hap
By death, a pleasant port, for aye
in rest them selves to shroud,
Where dreadful tumults never dwell
nor storms of Fortune proud:
Nor yet the burning fyry flakes
of Jove the same doth doubt,
whē wrongfully with twacking thūpes
he rappes his thunder out:
Hear lady peace thinhabitours
doth never put in flight,
Nor yet the victors threatny•g wrath
approaching nyg• to fight,
No whirling western wind doth •rge
the ramping seas to prance,
No dusty cloud that raised is
by savage Dimilaunce,
On horseback riding rank by rank,
no ferse and cruel ho•t,
No people slaughtered, with their towns
clean topsy tur•ey tossed:
While that the foe with flaming fire
doth spoil and wast the wall,
Untamed and unbridled Mars
destroys and batters all:
That man alone who forces not
the ficle fates a straw,
The visage grym of Acheront
whose eyes yet never saw,
Who never vewd with heavy cheer•
the vgsome Limbo lake,
And putting life in hazard dare
to death him self betake.
That parson is a princes pear,
and like the gods in might,
Who knows not what death doth mean
is in a piteous plight
The ruthful ruin of our na∣tyue
country we beheld:
That woeful night, in which the roof•
of houses ouerqueld,
In Dardans City blazing bright
with flashing fiery flames.
when as the Greeks with burning brands
enkindle did the frames,
That Troy whō war &amp; deeds of arms
might not subdue and take,
As once did mighty Hercules,
whose quiver ca•sde it quake,
Which neither he that Peleus son,
and son to Thetis was,
Nor whom Achilles loved to well,
could ever bring to pass,
When glittering bright in filled he ware
false armour on his back,
And counterfeiting fears Achill
the Troyans drove to wrack.
Nor when Achilles he him self
his mind from sorrow wrast,
And Trojan women to the walls
did scudding leap in hast.
In misery she lost her proud
estate, and last rename,
By being stoutly overcome,
and hardly pulled down.
Years five &amp; five did Troy resist,
that yet hereafter must,
In one nights space by destiny
be laid in the dust.
Their fained gifts well have we tri•
that huge and fatal gin:
We light of credit with our own
right hand have haled in,
That fatal gift of Greeks: what time
at entry of the gap
The ••go horse did shivering stand,
where in them selves did wrap
The captains close, in hollow vats
with bloody war yfreight.
When lawfully we might have tried,
and searched their deceight:
So by their own contryned snares
the greeks had bin confound:
The braseen buclers being shoke
did go•e a clattryng sound.
A privy whispering often times
came tickling in our ear.
And Pyrrhus (in a murreynes name
so ready for to heate.
The crafty council picked out
of false Vlisses brain,)
Did jangle in the hollow vats,
that rang thereof again.
But fearing and suspecting nought
the heady youth of Troy
Laid hands upon the sacred ropes,
to hale and pull with joy,
On this side young A•styanax
came guarded with his train,
On tother part Pollixena
disponsed to be slain
Upoon Achilles tomb, she com•
with maids, and he with men,
A jolly flock with equal years
as young as they were then.
Their vowed oblations to the gods
in holiday attire,
The matrons bring and so to church
repairs every sire.
And all the city did alike,
yea Hecuba our queen
(That since the woeful Hectors death
or now was never scene)
She merry is: o grefe accursed,
a• all thy sorrows deep
For which that first, or last befell,
intend thou to weep?
Our battered walls which heavenly han∣des
erected have and framed?
Or else the burning temples which
upon their Idols flamd?
Lamenting these calamities
we have not time and space,
O mighty parent Priam we
poor Troyans whale thy case.
The old mans thratlyng throt I saw,
(alas) I saw yborde
With cruel Pirrhus blade, that scante
with any blood was gored.
¶Refrain your tears y• down your chekes
should tricle evermore
With woeful waylynges piteously
your private friends deplore
My miseries refuse a mate,
so much accursed as I:
To few my careful case, refrain
your lamentable cry.
As for mine own distress to murne,
I shall suffice alone.
¶To mingle tears with other tears
it doth vs good to moan:
In those the burning teary streams
more ardently do boyle,
Whō secret thoughts of lurking •ares
in privy breast •urmoyle:
Though that thou were a gossop stout,
that brooke much sorrow may
I warrant the, thou might well,
lament this sore decay.
Not sad and solemn A•don
that in the woods doth singe
Her sugared ditties finely tunde
on sweet and pleasant string:
Recording •tys woeful hap
in divers kind of note,
whom Progne though he were her child
and of her womb begot,
For to revenge his fathers fault,
she did not spare to kill:
And gave his flesh and blood for food
the fathers maw to fill.
Nor Progne who in swallows shape•
upon the ridges hye,
Of houses sitts in Biston town
bewailing peteou•lye,
With chatteryng throat, of Tereus
her spouse the cruel act,
(Who did by strength &amp; force of arms
a shamfull brutish fact.
Defile the sister of his wife,
fair Philomel by name,
And •ache cut out her tongue, least she
should blab it to his shame)
Though Progne this her husbands rape
lamenting very sore
Do wail, and weep with piteous plaint,
yet can she not deplore
Sufycientlye, though that she would
our contreys petious plight:
Though he him self among the swans
sir Cygnus lyllye whight.
who dwells in stream of Ester ••ood,
and Tanais channel could,
His weeping voice most earnestly
though utter out he would:
Although the morning Halcyons
with doleful sighs do whale,
At such time as the fighting floods
their Cyex did assail,
Or rashly weryng bold attempt
the seas now laid at rest,
Or being very fearful fed
their brood in tottryng nest,
Although as sqeimysh hearted men
those preistes in bedlam rage,
Whom mother Cyble being borne
•n high in lofty stage,
Doth move, so play on shalmes, Atys
the Phrygian to lament,
Yet can not they this lot bewail,
though brawn frō arms they rent.
Cassandra in our tears there is,
no measure to refrain,
Those miseries all measure pa•se,
that plunged vs in payne.
The sacred fillets from thy heads,
why doest thou hale and pull?
They chiefly ought to worship god,
whose hearts with grefe be dull.
¶My fear by this aflyction
is clean abated al,
Nor prayeng to the heavenly ghosts
for mercy will I call.
Although they were disposed to chafe
and fret in fustian fumes:
They nothing have me to displease,
fortune her force consumes.
Her spyte is worn unto the stumps,
what country have I left?
Where is my sire? am I of all
my sisters quyt bereft.
The sacred tombs and alter stones
our blood have drunk and swyld,
Where are my bretherne blessed knot?
destroyed in the fylde.
All widow wives of Priams sons
may easly now behold,
The palace void and cast of court
of silly Priam old.
And by so many marriages
so many widows are,
But only Helen coming from
the coast of Lacon far.
That Hecuba the mother of
so many a princely wight,
whose frutful womb did breed y• brand,
of fire blasyng bright:
Who also bare the swinge in Troy,
by practis now doth learn,
New laws and guise of destiny
in bondage to discern.
On her she takes hart of grace
with looks so sterne and wild,
And barks as a bedlam bitch
about her strangled child
Dear Polidor, the remnant left,
and only hope of Troy,
Hector and Priam to revenge,
and to restore her joy.
¶ The sacred Phoebus prophet is
with sudden silence hushed:
A quaking trembling shivering fear
throughout her limbs hath rushed:
Her face as pale as ashes is,
her fillets stand upright,
The soft and gentle goldilocks
start up of her affrigyt.
Her panting breathing breast stuffed up
within doth grunt and groan.
Her glaring bright and steaming eyes
are hither and thither thrown•
Now glaūcyng up &amp; down they roll:
now standing stiff they stare.
she stretches up her head more straight
then commonly she bare,
Bolt up she goes, her wrestling jaws
that fast together clinge,
She doth attempt by divers means,
on sonder how to wring.
Her mōbling words in gabling mouth
shut up she doth assuage,
As Menas mad that Bacchus ares
doth serve in furious rage.
¶How doth it hap (o sacred tops
of high Parnassus hill)
That me be rapt of sens, with pricks
of fury fresh ye fill?
Why do you me with ghost inspire,
that am beside my wits?
O Phoebus none of thine I am,
releas me from the fits:
Infixed in my burning breasts
the flames extinguish out,
Who forces me with fury fell
to gad and trot about?
Or for whose sake inspird with spryte
mad momblyng make must I?
Why play I now the prophet cold,
sith Troy in dust doth lye?
The day doth shrink for dread of war,
the night doth dim mine eyes.
With mantle black of darkness deep
clean covered is the skies:
But lo two shining Suns at one•
in heaven appears bright,
Two Grecian houses muster do
their armies twain to fight.
Among the mighty Goddesses
in Ida woods I see,
The fatal shepherd in his throne
as vmpier placed to bee:
I do advise you to beware,
beware (I say) of kings,
(A kindred in whose cankered hearts
old privy grudges sprynges)
That country clown Aegisthus he
this stock shall overthrow,
What doth this foolish despret dame
her naked weapons show?
Whose crown entende•h she to crack
in weed of Lacon land,
With hatchet (by the Amazons
invented first) in hand?
What face of mighty majesty
bewitched hath mine eyes?
The conqueror of salvage beasts
Marmarick Lyon lies,
Whose noble neck is wurried
with currish fang and tooth
The churlish snappes of eager Li∣ones
abide he doth.
Alac ye gostes of all my friends
why should ye say that I,
Among the rest am onl•e safe,
from perils far to lye?
Fain father follow thee I wold,
Troy being laid in dust.
O brother terror of the Greeks,
O Troyans aid and trust.
Our ancient pomp I do not see,
nor yet thy warmed hands,
(That ferce on grekish flaminge flete
did fling the fyry brands)
But māgled mēbers, schorched corps,
and eake thy valiant arms,
Harde piniond and bound in bands
sustaining grievous harms:
O Troylus, a match unfit
encountering with Achill
(That mighty man of arms) to soon
com unto the I will.
I do delight, to sail with them
on stinking Stygian flood.
To view the churlish mastiff cu•
of hell, it doth me good.
And gaping mou•head kingdom dark
of greedy Ditis reign.
The barge of filthy Phlegethon
this day shall entertain,
Me conquering, and conquered,
and princes souls with all.
You flyteryng shades I you beseech,
and eake on the I call,
O Stygian poole (whereon the gods
their solemn oaths do take
Unbolt a while the brazen bars
of darksome limbo lake.
Whereby the Phrygian folk in hell
may Micean state be hold.
Loke up ye sellye wretched souls,
the fates are backward roulde.
The sqallye sisters do approach,
and deal their bloody strokes,
Their smultring faggots in their hāds
half burnt to ashes smokes.
Their visages so pale do burn,
with fyrye flaming eyes:
A garment black their gnawed guts
doth gyrde in morning guise.
Dire dred of night begins to howl,
the bones of body vast
With lieng long do rot corrupt
in miry puddle cast.
Behold, the weary aged man
his burning thirst forgot,
The waters dalyeng at his lips
to catch endeavours not:
But murneth for the funeral,
that shall ensue anon.
The Trojan prince his royal robes
triumphant puts on.
¶The furious rage clean overpassed
begins it self to slake,
And flips away, even as a Bull
that deadly wound doth take
On gashed neck afront the ares:
come let vs ease at last
Her limbs, that of the spryte of god
hath felt the mighty blast.
Returning home again at length
and cround with Laurel bow
(A sign of worthy victory)
is Agamemnon now.
The wit to mete her husband, doth
her spedy passage ply,
Returning hand in hand, and foot
by foot most lovingly.
AT length I do arrive again
upon my native soil•
God save the o dear loved land,
to thee is huge a spoil
So many barbarous people yield:
the flower of Asia Troy
To bear thy yoke submits her self,
that lunge did live in joy.
Why doth this prophet (on the groūd
her sprawling body laid)
Thus rele and stagger on her neck,
all trembling and dismayed?
Sirs, take her up, with liquor warm
let her be cherished.
Now peepes she up again, with drooping
eyes sonke in her head:
Pluck up thy spryte, here is the port
wished for in misery:
This day is festival.
¶At Troy
so was it wont to be.
¶Let vs to Chalters worship go•e.
¶At Chalters dyed my syer:
¶Pray we to Jove.
¶To Jove whose grace
divine doth me inspire?
¶Dost thou suppose that Troy you seist?
¶And Priam eke I see.
¶Troy is not here.
¶where Helen is
there take I Troy to bee.
¶Fear not as maid to serve thy dame.
¶Nay freedom draws ny.
¶take thou no thought how you shalt live:
¶All cares for to defy
Death gyves a courage unto me.
¶Yet say I once again
There is no danger left, whereby
thou might hurt sustain.
¶But yet much troublous daūger doth
hang over thy head I wot.
¶What mischief may a victor dread?
¶Even that he dreads not.
¶Ye trusty meny of my men
come cary her away,
Till of the spryte she rid her self,
lest fury force her say
That may be preiudicall,
her to•ge she can not frame.
To thee o father flinging furth
the lightnings flashing flame,
That dost disperse the clouds, &amp; rule
the course of every star,
And guide the Globe of earth, to whom
the booties won by war
With triumph victors dedicate:
to thee o Iuno hight
The sister dear of doughty Jove,
(thy husband full of myht)
Both I and Greece with flesh &amp; blood
and eke our vowed beast
And gorgyou•• gifts of Arabia
give worship to thy hest.
O Greece by noble Gentlemen
in honour shining clear,
O Greece to wrathful Iuno thou
that art the darling dear,
Some jolly worthy lusty blood
thou fosters evermore,
Thou hast made even the gods, yt were
a number od before.
That puissant mighty Hercules
a noble imp of thine
Deserved by his travels twelve,
rapt up in heaven to shyne.
For whom the heavens did alter course,
and Iupiter with all
Did iterate the hours of night,
when dampish dew doth fall.
And charged Phoebus chariot swift,
to trot with slower pace,
And leisurely bright lady moon
thy homward wayne to trace,
Bright Lucifer that year by year
his name a new doth change,
Came back again, to whom the name
of Hesper seemed strange.
Aurora to her comm•n course
her reared head addressed,
And couching bacward down again
the same she did arest,
Upon the shoulder of her spouse,
whose years with age are worn
The east did feel, so felt the west,
that Hercules was borne.
Dame nature could not clean dispatch,
to utter in one night,
That boystous lad: the whirling world
did wayght for such awyght.
O babe whose sholders underprop,
the ample spacious sky,
In clasped arms thy prowes did
the crushed Lion try.
Who from his fyrye yawning throat
spewes out his broiling brand,
The nimble hynd in Menall mount
hath known thy heavy hand.
The Bore hath felt thy fist, which di•
Arcadia destroy.
The monstrous conquered Bull hath rord
that Creta did annoy.
The Dragon dire that bredyng beast
in Lerna poole he slew,
And choppyng of one head forbadd
thereof to rise anew.
Wtih cloobbed bruising battring bat
he cranckly did subdue.
(The bretherne twins y• tewd on teat)
whereof .iii. monsters grew.
Of triple formed Gerion
the spoil into the east,
A drove of cattle Hercules
did fetch out of the west.
Away from tyrant Diomede
the Thracian horse he led
Which nether with the grass that grew
by Styrmon flood he fed,
Nor yet on Heber banks, but them
the villain did refresh
His greedy mounching cramming jade
with aliantes blood and flesh.
Their rawfed jaws imbrewd were with
the carmans blood at last,
The spoils and shaftes Hipolyte
saw from her bosom wrast
As soon as he with clatryng shaft
the dusky cloud did smite,
The Stymphal bird that shadowed
the sun, did take her flight.
The fertile tree that apples bears
of gould, did fear him sore,
Which never yet acquaintance had
with •asters toth before.
But whipping up with lively twigs
into the ayre she flies,
And while the chinking plate doth soūd
then Argos full of eyes,
The watchman shrinking close for cold
that sleep yet never knew,
Doth here the noise while Hercules
with mettle of yellow hew
Well laden packs away, and left
the grove befylched clean.
The hound of hell did hold his tongue
drawn up in triple cheane,
Nor barked with any boughing throat,
nor could abide the hew,
Or colour of the heavenly light,
whose beams he never knew.
When thou were captain general,
and did conduct our Host,
(They that) of Dardans lygne, to come
their stock do falsely boast,
Were vanquished by force of arms
and since they felt again
thy gray goose wing, whose bitterness
to fear might them constrain.
WIthin a revel rex is kept,
as sore as ever was
Euē at ye .x. years siege of Troy:
What thing is this? (alas)
Get up my soul, and of the rage
auengment worthy crave:
Though Phrygians we be vanquished,
the victory we have.
The matter well is brought abought:
up Troy thou rysest now,
Thou flat on floor haste pulled down Greece,
to lye as low as thou.
Thy conqerour doth turn his face:
my propheseing spryght
Did never yet disclose to me
so notable a sight:
I see the same, and am thereat,
and busied in the broil,
No vision fond fantastical
my senses doth beguile:
Such fare as Phrygians feasted with
on last unhappy night
At Agamemnons royal court
full daintily they dight:
With purple hangings al adorned
the brodred beds do shyne,
In old Assaracks goblets gilt
they swinck and swill the wine.
The king in gorgeous royal robes
on chair of state doth sit,
And pranckt with pride of Priams pomp
of whom he conquered it.
Put of this hostile wed, to him
(the queen his wife began say)
And of thy loving lady wrought
wear rather this array,
This garmēt knit. It makes me loathe,
that shivering here Island.
O shall a king be murdered, by
a banished wretches hand?
Out, shall Thadulterer destroy
the husband of the wife?
The dreadful destinies approached.
the food that last in life
He taste•d of before his death,
their masters blood shall see,
The gubs of blood down dropping on
the wind shall powered bee.
By traytrous tryck of trapping wed
his death is brought about,
Which being put upon his head
his hands could not get out,
The stopped poake with mouth set op•
his muffled head doth hyde,
The mankind dame with trembling hand
the sword drew from her side,
Nor to the utmost of her might
it in his f•esh she thrast,
But in the giving of the stroke
she stayed all aghast,
He as it were a bristled Bore
entangled in the net
Among the briers in bushy woods
yet tries out to get.
with struggling much the shrinking bands
more straightly he doth bind.
He strives in vain, and wold slip of
the snare that doth him blind.
Which catches hold on every side.
but yet then tangled wretch
Doth grope about, his subtle foes
with grypyng hand to catch.
But furious Tyndaris prepared
the pollax in her hand,
And as the preyst to sacrifice
at Thalter side doth stand,
And views with eye the bullocks neck,
ear that with axe he smite,
So to and fro she heaves her hand
to strike and level right.
He hath the stroke: dispatcht it is:
not quyte chopped of the head
It hangs by a little crop:
here from the carcass ded
The spouting blood cam gushing out:
and there the head doth lye,
With waloing bobling mūbling tong:
nor they do by and bye
Forsake him so: the breathless coors
Aegist doth all to coil:
And mangled hath the gashed corpse:
while thus he doth him spoil,
She puts to her helping hand:
by detestable dede
They both accord unto the kind,
whereof they do proceed.
Dame Helens sister right she is,
and he Thyestes son:
Lo doubtful Titan stands styll
the day now being don,
Not knowing whether best to keep
styll on his wonted way
Or turn his wheles unto the path
of dire Thiestes day.
O Thou whom of our fathers death
the only help we have,
Fly, fly, frō force of furious foes,
make hast my self to save:
Our house is topsey turuey tossed,
our stock• is cast away,
Our ruthful realms to ruin run,
our kingdoms do decay.
Who comes here in Chariot swift
this galloping a mayne?
Brother, disguised in thy wed
let me thy person fain.
O buzzard blind what dost thou mean
from foreign folk to fly?
Whom dost thou shun? it doth behove
to fear this family.
Orestes now be bold, and set
all shivering fear a side,
The certain succour of a trusty
friend I h•ue espied.
WIth solemn pomp I Strophilus
forsaking Phocis land,
Bearing a braūche of palm, yt grows
at Elis in my hand,
Returned back I am, the cause
that wyld me hither wend,
Is with these gifts to gratify
and welcome home my friend,
Whose valiyent army scald, &amp; shook
the tattryd Trojan walls,
Who wearied with the ten years war
now flat on floor she falls.
What woeful wight is this that staines
her mourning face with tears,
And drowned deep in drowsy dumps
oppressed is with fears?
I know full well this damsel i•
of princes lynage borne.
What cause Electra hath this joy∣full
family to morn?
¶By treason that mi mother wrought
my father lies slain,
And drinking of their fathers cup
the children do complain.
Aegist engroceth Castles got
by fornication.
¶Alack that of so lunge a time•
fylicitie is none.
¶I thee request even for the love
my father thou doest owe,
And for the honour of the crown,
whose brute abroad doth grow
In every coast: and by the gods
that diversely do •eal,
Take into thy tuition,
convey away, and steal,
This poor Orest: such kind of theft
is piety indeed.
¶Although that Agamemn•n• death
doth teach me to take heed,
Yet will I under•ache the same,
and with all diligence
Orestes shall I go about
with strength to have thee hence.
Prosperity requires faith,
but troble exacts the same,
Have here a price for those that do
contend and wage in game.
An ornament with comely grace
ordained to deck the brow,
And let thy head be •ouerde with
this greene and pleasant bow.
And cary this victorious
triumphant branch in hand.
God grant this palm yt planted was
in fertile Pisa land,
(where solemn games were celebrate
Ioues honour to express)
May both a safeguard be to to thee
and bring thee good success.
Thou that bestryds thy fathers steeds,
as he before hath done,
Go strike a league of amity
with Pylades my son.
Now nimble nagges let Greece hereof
recording testify,
With headlong scouring course amain
this traytrous country fly.
¶He is escaped and gone, and with
unmeasurable might
The Chariot horse with rain at will
do send out of my sight.
Now free from peril on my foes
attendance will I make.
And offer willingly my head
the deadly wound to take.
The cruel conquers of her spouse
is come, whose spotted wed
With sprynkels (sign of slaughter) do
bear record of her dede.
Her gory hands new bathed in blood
as yet they be not dry,
Her rough &amp; churlish rigorous looks
the fact do notify.
Unto the temple will I trudge.
Cassandra suffer me,
Oppressed with eagle grief, take part
of sacrifice with thee.
O Thou thy mothers enemy,
ungracious saucy face,
After what sort dost thou a maid
appear in public place?
¶I have with my virginity
the bowers of bawds forsook.
¶What man is hee, that ever thee
to be a virgin took?
¶what your own daughter?
¶with thy mother
more modest should you be.
¶Do you at length begin to preach,
such godliness to me.
¶A manly stomach stout thou hast
with swelling haughty hart.
Subdued with sorrow learn thou shall
to play a women's part.
¶A swerd and buckler very well
a woman doth beseme
(Except I dote)
¶ •hy self doe•• you
haylefelow with vs esteem?
¶What Agamemnon new is this,
whom thou hast got •f late?
¶Hereafter shall I tame, and teach
thy girlish tong to prate.
And make the know, how to a queen
•hy taunting •o for bear.
¶The whilst (you widow) answer me
directly to this gear.
Thy husband is •ereued quite
of breath, his life is don.
¶Enquier where thy brother is,
So seek about my son.
¶He is departed out of Gre•e.
¶Go fetch him out of hand.
¶Fetch thou my father unto me.
¶Give me to understand,
Where doth he lurking hyde his head?
where is he shrunk away?
¶All plonge of perils past he is,
a•d at a quiet staye.
And in another kingdom where
no harm he doth mistrust,
This answer were sufficient,
to please a parent just.
But one whose breast dothboil in wrath,
it cannot satisfy.
¶To day by death thou shalt receive
thy fatal destiny.
¶On this condition am I pleased,
the Alter to forsake.
If that this hand shall do the dead,
my death when I shall take.
Or else if in my throat to bathe
thy blade, thou do delight,
Most willingly I yield my throat,
and give the leave to smy•e.
Or if thou will chop of my head
in brutish beastly guise,
My neck a waytyng for the wound
out stretched ready lies.
Thou hast committed sinfully
a great and grievous guylt.
Go purge thy hardened hands, y• which
thy husbands blood have spell•.
¶O thou that of my perils all
doest suffer part with me,
And in my realm doest also rule
with eagle dignity,
Aegisthus art thou glad at this?
(as doth her not behove,)
With checks &amp; taunts y• daughter doth
her mothers malice move.
She kepes her brothers counsel close
Conveyed out of the way.
¶Thou malapert and wi•les wench
thine eluysh pra•yng staye,
Refrain those words unfit thy mo∣theirs
glowing ears to vex.
¶What shall the breder of this broil
control me with his checks,
Whose fathers gilt hath caused him
to have a doubtful name,
Who both is to his sister son,
and nephew to the same?
¶To snap her head of with thy swerd
Aegist doest thou refrain?
Let her give up the ghost: or bring
Her brother straight again:
Let her be locked in dungeon dark,
and let her spend her days,
In Caves &amp; Rocks, with painful pangs,
torment her every ways.
I hope him whom she hidden hath,
she will again descry,
Through being clapped in prison strong
and suffering poverty
With earksom and unsavoury smells
on every side annoyed,
En•orst to wear a widows wed,
er wedding day enjoyed:
Put in exile and banishment
when eche man doth her hate:
So shall she be by misery
compelled to yield to late,
Prohibited of wholesome air
fruision to have.
¶Graūt me mi dome bi means of death
to pass unto my grave.
¶I would have granted it to the,
if thou should it deny.
Unskilful is the tyrant, who
by suffering wretches dye•
Doth end their pains.
¶what after death
doth any thing remain?
¶And if thou do desire to dye,
the same se you refrain.
Lay hāds •errs on this wōdrous wretch,
whom being carried on,
Even to the furthest corner of
my jurisdiction
Far out beyond Mycenas land
in bonds let her be bound,
With darkness dim in hiddious hold
let her be closed round.
This captive spouse &amp; wicked queen,
the trull of princes bed
Shall pay her pains, and suffer death
by losing of her head.
Com hale her on, that she may follow,
that way my spouse is gon,
Whose love •rome me enticed was.
¶Do not thus hale me on.
I will before you take the way,
these tidings first to tell
Unto my country men of Troy
beneath in lowest hell.
How ouerquelmed ships eche whea•
are spread the sea• upon•
And Micoene country conquered is
brought in subjection.
He that of thousand captains was
grand captain general,
Com to as great calamity
as Troy it self did fall,
Entrapped was by treaytrus train,
and whoredom of his wife,
And by a gift received of her
depreued of his life.
Let vs not linger: on with me,
and thanks I do you give.
I joy, that it might be my hap,
thus after Troy to live.
¶Go to, prepare thy self to dye
thou frantic raging wight.
¶The frenzy fits of fury fell
on you shall also light.
ALas ye hateful •ellysh hags
ye furies foul and fell,
Why cause ye rusty rancours rage
in noble hearts to dwell•
And cankered hate in boiling breasts
to grow from age to age?
Cold not the graūdsyres painful pāges
the childrens wrath assuage?
Nor •a•in faint of pining paunch,
with burning thurste of hell,
Amid the blackest stream of sticks
where poysnyng breathes do well.
Where vapors vile parbrakyng out
from dam•ysh miry mud,
Increase the pains of Tantalus
deserved by gyltles blood.
Could not thine own offence suffice
Thyestes in thy life,
To fyle thy brothers spousal bed,
and to abuse his wife?
But after breath from body fled,
and life thy limbs hath left,
Can not remembrance of revenge
out of thy breast be reft?
What, yet hast thou not laid thy lips,
to cast of Lethes flood?
Now after death why dost thou come
to move thy son to blood?
Could cruel Ditis grant to thee
thy passport back again?
To work this wo upon the world,
and make such rigour reign,
That Clytemnestr• is become
the fifty sister dire
Of Danaus daughters, that did once
their husbands death conspire.
Lo here how •isle fortune gyves
but brittle fading joy.
Lo, be who late a Conqueror
triumphed over Troy.
Enduring many sturdy Forms
with m•ghty toil and payne
To sow the seed of fame, hath reant
small fruit thereof again.
When as his honour budding furth
with flower began to bloom,
(Alas) the stock was hewed down
and sent to deadly doom.
And they that of his vyctorie
and coming home were glad,
to sudden murning change their mirth
with heaviness bestad.
The lusty pomp of royal court
is dead: (O dolfull day)
The people moan their princes death
with wo and weal away:
with howling, crieng, wringing hands
with sobs with sighs, and tears,
And with their •ists they beat their bre•tes
they pull and hale their hears.
And as the sheep amassed run,
and ramp about the field,
When as their shepherd to the wolf
his gory throat doth ye•lt:
Even so as mad they rage and rave
throughout Maecenas land,
Deprived of their prince, they fear
the bloody Tyrants hand.
While thus were woeful wailings hard
in every place about,
The good Cassandra (come from Troy)
to death is haled out.
Like as the Swan, who when the time
of death approaches ny,
By nature warned is thereof,
and pleased well to dye,
Doth celebrate her •unerall
with dirge and solemn songe:
Even so the noble virgin who
in wo hath lived lunge,
Most joyful goes she to her death
with mild and pleasant face,
Stout boulst ring out her bourly breast
with princely port &amp; grace.
Nothing dysma•de with courage bold,
and cheerful countenance,
On stage ordained for her death
she began her self advance,
As though she had not thither come,
to leave her loathsome life,
As though she had not come, to taste
the stroke of fatal knife.
But even as if in bridal bed
her iurney were to meet
Corebus dear, not having mind
of death, nor winding sheet,
When looking round on every side
she toke her leave of all,
From vapourd eyes of young and whole•
the tryclyng tears do fall.
The Greeks them selves to grief a•• moved
to see this heavy sight,
So pity poorest the headmans hart,
that thryse about to •myte
He staide the smote: with shivering hand
yet once again he tried.
And frō her shoulders stroke her head.
and thus the virgin dyed.
But now the Greeks another cause
of murnyng have in hand:
Orestes Agamemnons son,
is for•st to fly the land.
Among old rotten ragged rocks
•hear lies an ugly place,
A dungeon dep•, as dark as hell,
unknown to Phoebus face.
An hollow huge wide gaping hole,
with way styll bending down,
whose mouth with venomous withered weeds
is hid &amp; over grown,
where stinking smells com belching out
from filthy dirty dyke,
where verment vile do crepe &amp; craule,
in bell is not the like.
Il favoured, foul misshapen •ugges,
do lurk about this cave,
With dreadful sounds• &amp; roaring noise
within the pyt they rave.
Even hither is Electra sent,
in darkness deep to lye,
In poverty, and comfortless
without the light of sky,
Fast clogd with iron bolts &amp; chains,
thus by her mother laid
In torments, till by her to death
Orestes be betrayed:
Who (as Cassandra tells) shall
revenge his fathers death,
Deprive with swerd thadulterour,
and mother both of breath.
So after all these bloody broils,
Greece never shall be free:
But blood for blood, and death by turns,
the after age shall see.

O Gods whose grace doth guide their gob∣•les
that joy in wedlock pure,
O Iuno thou Lucina hight,
on whom the chary cure
Allotted is of those, that groan
in painful chyldbed •andes,
O Pallas by whose heavenly art
Sir Typhis conning hands
Have learned to bridle with his helm
his newly framed boat,
Wherewith the force of fighting fluddes
he breaking rides a flote.
O God whose forked Mace doth storms
in rigour rough appease,
And cause the ruffling surges couch
amid the romping Seas:
O Titan who upon the swift
and whirling Hemisphaer
D•uides the cheerful day and night
by eagle turns tipper.
O threfolde shapen Hec•te
that send furthe thy light,
Unto thy sylent Sacrifice
that offered is by night,
By whom my Iason swear to me
o heavenly powers all,
And ye on whom Medea •aye
with safer conscience call,
O Dungeon dark•, most dreadful den
of everlasting night,
O dampned gohstes: o kingdom set
against the gods aright:
O Lord of sad and lowrynge lakes,
o Lady dire of Hell,
(Whom though that Pluto stale biforce
yet did his •roth excel
The ficle faith of Iasons love,
that he to me doth bear,)
With cursed throat I conjure you,
o grys•ye gohstes appear.
Come out, come out, ye hellish hags,
revenge this deed so dire,
Bring in your scratting paws a bur∣nyng
brand of deadly fire.
Rise up ye hiddiuos devilish fiends,
as dreadful as ye wear,
When unto me in wedlock state
ye did sometime appear.
Work ye, work ye, the dole full death
of this new wedded wife.
And martyr ye this father in law:
deprive of breath and life
King Croons ruthful family:
in plunge of passing payne
Torment ye me, that on my spouse
do wish this woe to reyne:
Preserve my Iasons life, but yet
let him be baited out
A mychyng, rogyng, runagate,
in foreign towns about.
To pass from door to door, with care
to beg his noddy bread.
Not knowing in what harbryng place
to couch his cursed head:
A banished wretch, dysdaynd of all,
and styll in fear of life,
Then let him wish ten thousand times
for me again his wife:
This famous gest whom every man
will entertain and have,
Let him be dryuē at strangers gates
the table crūmes to crave.
And that my bitter bannynges may
with mischief most abound,
God grant in gulf of like distress
his children may be drounde,
To sink in sorrows storms, that do
there mother overflow:
Now, now, I have, I have the full
revenge of all my woe.
I have dispatcht: my piteous plaint
and words in vain I lose:
What shall not I with violence
get up against my foes?
And wring out of their wrested hādes
the wedding torch so bright?
Shall I not force the firmament
to lose his shrinking light?
What doth my grandsirs Phoebus face
this heavy hap behold?
And standing gasyng at this gear
yet westward is he told,
On glistering chariot hoisted high,
and kepes his beaten race,
Amid the crystal coloured sky,
why turns he not his face,
Retiring fast into the East
back up the day to twyne?
O father Phoebe to me, to me,
thy Chariot reigns resign,
That I advanced up, about
the marble skies may ride,
Bequeath thy bridle unto me,
and give me grace to guide
Thy yoked prancing team, with yer∣king
lash of burning whip,
That with thy fervent fyry beams
on purple poale doe skip.
Let Corinthe country burnt to dust
by force of flame and fire
Give place, that both the •umbled seas
may join: whom to retire
It doth compel, and dassheth of
from bank on either side,
Least mete in one their channels might,
whose streams he doth divide.
No way to work their deadly woe
I have but this at hand,
That to the wedding I should bear
a ruthful bridal brand,
Anoyenge Croons careless Court:
when finished I have
Such solemn s•ruyce, as that right•
of sacrifice do the crave,
Then at the Alters of the Gods
my children•n shall be slain,
With crimson coloured bl•od of babes heart,
their alters will I stain.
Through livers, lounges the lights &amp;
through every gut and gall,
For vengeaūce break away perforce,
and spare no blood at all:
If any lusty life as yet
within thy soul do rest,
I fought of ancient courage styll
doe dwell within my breast,
Exile all foolish female fear,
and pie•ye from thy mind,
And as thuntamed Tigers use
to rage and rave unkind,
that haunt the croaking combrus caves
and clumpred frozen cliues,
And craggy rocks of Caucasus,
whose bitter cold deprives
The soil of all inhabytours,
permit to lodge and rest,
Such sa•uage brutish tyranny
within thy brazen breast.
What ever hurly burly wrought
doth Phases understand,
What mighty moustrous blody feat
I wrought by sea or land:
The like in Corinth shall be seen
in most outrageous guise,
Most hiddious• hateful, horrible,
to hear, or see with eyes.
Most d•uelysh, desperate dreadful dede,
yet never known before,
Whose rage shall force heaven, earth &amp; hell
to quake and tremble sore.
my burning breast that rolls in wrath
and doth in rancour boyle,
Sore thrysteth after blood, &amp; wounds
with slaughter, death and spoil,
By renting racked limbs from limbs
to drive them down to grave:
•ush, these be but as Fleabytynges,
that mentioned I have:
As weyghtie things as these I did
in greener girlish age,
Now sorrows smart doth rub the gall
and frets with sharper rage.
But sith my womb hath yielded fruit,
it doth me well behove,
The strength and parlous pu•ssaunce
of weightier ills to •rove.
Be ready wrath, with all thy might
that fury kindle may,
Thy foes to their destruction
be ready to assay:
Of thy divorcement let the Price
to match, and counterpoise
The proud &amp; precious princely pomp
of these new wedding days.
How wilt thou frō thy spouse depart?
as him thou followed hast
In blood to •athe thy blody hands
and traytrous lives to wast.
Break of in time these long delays,
abandon now again,
This lewd alliance, got by gilt,
with greater gilt refrain,
WHo hath not wist that windy words be •own•,
A•d that in talk of trust is not the g•and,
Here in a mirror may he see it plain,
Medea so by •to•fe the same hath found.
Who being blind by blinded Venus boy,
Her bleared eyes could not behold her bliss:
Nor spy the present poison of her joy•,
While in the gr•sse the Serpent lurked is.
The shaft that flew from Cupids golden bow,
With feathers so hath die•d her daseld eyes,
That can not see to shun the way of woe:
The rancklyng head in dent•d ha•te that lies,
So dulls the same, that can not understand
The cause that brought false Iason out of Greec••
To come unto her fathers fertile land,
Is not her love, but love of golden Fleece.
Yet was his speech so pleasant and so mild,
His tongue so fylde, his promises so fair,
Sweet was the fowlers songe that hath beguiled
The sly bird, brought to the limed snare.
Faith, in his face, trust shy•ed in his eyes,
The blushing brow plain m•nynge seemed to show,
In double ha•te black treason hidden lies,
Dissembling thoughts that weave the web of woe.
The honeyed lips, the tongue in sugar depte
Do• sweet the poison rank within the breast,
In subtle show of painted sheath is kept,
The rusty knife of treason deemed least,
Life seems the bait to sight that lies brim,
Death is the hook that vnderlyes the same,
The candle blase delights with burning trym,
The Fly, till ••e be burned in the flame,
Who in such shows least them•d any ills.
The hungry fish fears not the bait to Brooke,
Till up the lyne doe pluck him by the gylles,
And fast in throat hee feles the deadly hook.
Woe Iason, woe to thee most wretched man,
Or rather wretch Medea woe to thee,
Woe to the one that thus dyssem•le can,
Woe to the other that trained so might be.
Thoughst thou Medea his eyes to be the glass
When•in thou might the face of thoughts behold,
That in his breast with words so covered was,
As cankered brass with gloss of yellow gold?
Did thou suppose that nature (more then kind)
Had placed his heart his lie•nge lips between,
His looks to be the mirror of his mind?
Faith in fair face hath ••ldome yet ben seen.
Who list•eth to the flattering Mermaids note,
Must needs commit his tyred eyes to sleep,
Ye•lding to her the •eking of his boat,
That means unwary to drown him in the deep.
What boteth the• Medea to betraye
The golden Fleece, to fawning Iasons hand,
From Dragons teethe him safely to convey,
And fyrye Bulls the warders of the land?
Why for his sake from father hast thou fled,
And thrust thy self out from thy native soil?
Thy brothers blood what ay••d thee to shed,
With Iason thus to travel and to •oil?
Behold the mead of this thy good de•a•te,
The recompense that he to thee doth go•e.
For pleasure, payne, for joy, most eager smart,
With cloggyng ca•es in banishment to lie•e.
Tho•, and thy babes, are like to •egg and ••are•e,
In Nation stra•nge, (o miserable life)
While Iason from his promises doe •wa•u•,
And takes delight in his new wedded wife.
O ground vngrate, that when the husband man
Hath tilled it, to recompense his toil
No corn, but weeds, and •h•stles cendder can,
To ••ynge dys hands, that truyte seeks of his soil.
Such venom grows of pleasant coloured flower:
Lo•, princes lo, what deadly poison sup
Of ba•e, erst sweet, now turned into sow•,
Mede• dranc•• out of a golden c•p.
AYe me alas I am undone,
for at the bridal cheer
The warble note of wedding songe
resoūded in mine ear.
Yet for all this scant I my self,
yet scant believe I can,
That Iason would play such a prank,
amoste vnthanckfull man,
Both of my country, and my sire,
and kingdom me to spoil,
And yet forsake me wretch forlorn,
to straye in foreign soil.
O hath he su•h such a stony heart,
that doth no more esteem,
The great good turns, and benefits
that I employed on him?
Who knows, that I have lewdly used
enchantments for his sake,
The rigour rough, and stormy rage,
of swelling seas to slake.
The grunting fyryefomyng Bulls
whose smoking guts were stuffed
With smoltering fumes, y• from their jaws,
&amp; nostrils out they puffed
I stopped their gnashing moūching mou∣these
I quēcht their burning breath,
And vapors hot of stewyng paunch,
that else had wrought his death.
Or fedes he thus his fancy fond,
to think my skill of charm
Abated is, and that I have
no power to doe him harm?
Bestract of wits, with wavering mind
perplexed on every part,
I tossed, and turmoiled am,
with way ward crazy heart.
Now this, now that, and neither now,
but now another way,
By divers means I toil, that so
my wrong revenge I may.
I would the wretch a brother had:
but what? he hath a wife.
Go cut her throat, with ghastly woūdes
bereave her of her life.
On her isle work my deadly spyte,
her, her alone I crave,
To quit such bitter sousing storms,
as I sustained have.
If any grand notoryus gilt
in all Pelasga land
Be put in practyse yet unknown
unto thy harming hand,
Thereof to get experience
the time doth now begin:
Thy former feats doe bid thee take•
good hope• to thryue herein:
Let al thy gilts with thronging thic•
assemble thee to aid,
The golden Fleece (the chief novel)
of Colchis Isle betrayed.
My tender brother eke, that with
my sier did me pursue,
Whom with his secrete parts cut of
I wicked virgin slew,
Whose shredded &amp; dismembered corps,
with swerd in gobbits hewd,
(A woeful coarse toth fathers heart)
on Pontus ground I strewd.
How horye he added P•lias
his withered age to shift
To grener years, for longer life,
his daughters by my drift
His members all and mangled flesh
with liquor scalding hot
Ysodden, and parboiled have,
in seething brazen pot.
How oft in heinous blood have these
my cruel hands ben dyed?
And never any gilt as yet
by wrath inflamed I tried.
But now the parlous poysnyng woūd
of Cupids piercing dart
Doth boyle and rage within my breast,
it rancles at my heart.
But how could Ease•n it redress,
whom fortunes froward will
Hath ye•lt unto another hand,
at lust to save or spyll?
O rage of rusty cankered mind
this sclaundrous talk amend,
If fortunes grace will grant it thus,
let him unto his end
Live styll my Iason as he was,
but if not Iason mine,
Yet caitiff suffer Iason live,
though Iason none of thine:
Who being mindful styll of vs
some favour let him show,
For these good turns yt our good will
could erst on him bestow:
King Croon is in all the fault,
and only worthy blame,
Who puffed up with sceptre proud,
unable for to frame
His tickle mind to modesty,
made breach tu•xt vs again,
Whom Hymens bands, and link of love
had made but one of twain,
By whom eke from her •ender brats
the mother (wretch) is drawn,
He breaks the vow, that gaged is
with such a precious pawn.
Seek after such a villains blood,
in dan•ynge pangs of smart
Let him alone be surely dowst,
such is his due desert,
A dunghill heaped of Cinders burnt
his Palace make I shall,
that Malea where in winding strightes,
the lingering ships doe crall,
Shall case on smolthryng turrets tops
turmoylde in crackling flame.
¶For godsake madame I you pray
your tongue to silence frame.
Eke hyde your privy languishing
and grief in secret vain:
Who with a modest mind abides
the spurs of pricking payne,
And suffered sorrows patiently,
may it repay again.
Who bears a privy grudge in breast,
and kepes his malice close,
When least suspection is thereof
may most annoy his foes.
He leases opportunity
who vengeance doth require,
That shows by open sparks the flame
the heate of kindled fire.
¶Small is the grype of grief that can
to reasons lore obey,
And snekyng down with steling steps
can stylie slyppe away.
But they that thoroughly soused are
with showers of greater payne,
Can not digest such corsyes sharpe,
but cast it up again:
Fain would I give them trouncing girds.
¶Good daughter dere assuage
Thunbrydled swaye, and boiling heat
of this thy giddy rage:
Scant moist thou purchase quietness
although thou hold thy tongue.
¶The valiant heart dame Fortune yet
durst never harm with wrong
But dreading dastards down she dri∣ues.
¶If any courage dure,
And harbred be in noble breast,
now put the same in ur.
¶The show of sturdy valiant heart
at any time doth shyne.
¶No hope doth in adversity
the way to scope assign.
¶He that ha•h none affiance lefts,
nor any hope at all,
Yet let him not mistrust the luck
of ought that may befall.
¶Thy Country clean hath cast thee of
to let thee sink or swim,
As for thy husband Iason he,
there is no trust in him:
Of all the wealth, and worldly muck
wherewith thou did abound:
No portion remains at all,
whereby some help is found.
¶Medea yet is left, (to much.)
and here thou may espy
The Seas to succour vs in flight,
and lands aloof that lye:
Yea iron tools, with burning brands
we have to work them woe,
And Gods that with the thunder dynt
shall ouerquell our foe:
¶who wears y• goldēcrested crown
him dread with awe ye should.
¶My father was a king, yet I
betrayed his Fleece of gould:
¶Can not the deadly violence
of weapons make the fear?
¶No though such grisly lads they were
as meanwhile did appear,
That bred of gargell dragons teethe
in hollow gaping ground,
When mutually in blody fight
eche other did confound.
¶Then will thou cast thy self to death,
¶Would God that I were dead.
¶Fly, fly to save thy life.
¶w• worth the time that once I fled.
¶What o Medea.
¶Why shall I fly?
¶A mother dere art thou,
Fly therefore for thy childrens sake.
¶Ye see by wh•m, and how,
A wretched mother I am made.
¶Thy life by flight to save
dost thou mistrust?
¶Nay, fly I will,
but vengeance first isle have.
¶Then some shall thee at heals pursue,
to wreck the same again
¶Perhap isle make his coming short.
¶Be still, and now refrain.
O despret dame thy thondring threats,
and slake your raging ire.
Apply, and frame thy froward will
as time and tides require.
¶Full well may fortūes weltyng whele
to begging bring my state,
As for my worthy courage that
she never shall abate.
Who bouncing at ye gates, doth cause
the creakinge doors to jar?
It is the wretch Croon his self,
whom princely power far
Hath lift aloft, with lordly look,
paft up with pouncing pride,
That he may Corinth country with
the swaye of sceptre guide.
MEdea that ungracious imp
king Aetas wicked child
Yet hath not from our carfull realm
her lingering foot exiled.
Some nought drift she goes about,
her knackes of old we know,
Her juggling arts, her harming hands
are known well lunge ago.
From whō will she with hold her harm?
whom will this cruel beast
Permit to live from peril fre
in quietness and rest?
Clean to cut of this parlous plauge
it was our purpose bent,
But Iason by •ntreting hard
did cause vs to relent.
At his request we granted have
her life she shall enjoy,
Let her acquit our country fre
from fear of all annoy:
Yea safely let her pack her hence,
in eager giddy fit
With lompish lowering look she coms
in talk with me to knitt:
Sirs keep her of, and set her hence,
lest vs she touche per hap,
And drive her back from cōming nigh
command her keep her clap.
And let her learn at length, how that
her self submit she may,
The puissant payse and majesty
of princes to obey.
Run, hie the quickly, trudge apace,
have hence out of my sight
This horrible, most odious queen,
this monstrous wicked wight.
¶My sovereign liege, what greater crime
have I or less offence
Commit against thy majesty,
to be exiled hence?
¶Alas the gyltles woman doth
demand a reason why:
¶If thou be judge indifferent,
ordained my cause to try,
Consider then my doubtful case,
and way the ground of it:
If thou b• king, cōmaunde a Judge
for •uch a matter fit.
¶The princes power thou shalt obey,
bit either right or wrong.
¶The prosperus pride of wronging crowns
cannot endeavour lunge.
¶Avaunt, &amp; yell out thy complaints
at Colchis, get thee hence.
¶Full gladly will I get me home,
if he that brought me thence
Vouchsafe to b•are me back again.
¶Alas to la•e arise
Entreating words, when as decree
is taken otherwise.
¶He that not hearing either part
pronounces his decree,
Unryghteous man accounted is,
though right his sentence bee.
¶While Polios trusted to thy talk,
from life to death be fell.
Go to, begin, we give you leave
your goodly tale to tell.
¶That type of regal majesty•
that erst by Fortunes hand•
Advanced to I did attain,
hath taught me understand,
How harde a thing it is of wrath
the rigour to assuage,
When burning heat o• boiling breast
in flames begins to rage.
Eke for thaduaūcement of their power
more to display in sight
Their kingly courage bolstred out
with my•sty of might.
They d•me it doth import aswaye,
and hath a •reater grace,
Whom stately sceptre caused to climb
aloft to prouder place.
To persevere with fancy fond,
in that to reasons spite,
Whose greedy choice attainted first
his mind with vain del•light.
For though in piteous plight I lye,
thrown down to great decay,
With heau• hap, and ruthful chance,
to miserable staye,
Thus hunted out from place to place,
forsook and left alone,
A widow while my husband live,
with cause to wa•le and moan,
Perplexed in maze of misery,
with cloying cares so r•se,
Yet whysom I in golden trone
have led in happy life.
By high and noble parentage
my bright renoune doth shine.
From Phebus eak my grandsire great
derived is my ligne.
Where silver streamed Phases flood
his wasshyng waives doth shed,
Or with contrary croaking ways
his bathing channel spread.
what ever wandering coast stretched out
is left aloof behind,
From whence the roaming Scithyan sea
his channel furthe doth find,
Where as Meotis fenny plasshe
with pure fresh water sprynges
Doth season sweet the briny sea,
that tide in thither brings.
Eke all the coasts environed
and kept within the banks
Of Thermodon, where warlike troupes,
and armed widows ranks,
with painted bucklers on their arms
hold all the land in fear,
with rigour rough of threatening swerd
with force of dentyng spear.
So far to al these wandering coasts
and cuntreyes round about,
My fathers ample regiment
at large is stretched out.
I being thus of noble race
and in an happy plight,
With glorious gloss of princely pomp
in honour shining bright,
Then pearlesse pears my spousal bed
did sek• and sew to have,
But those to be their loving feres
now other Ladies crave,
Rash, tickle, peevish, indiscreet,
and waueryug fortunes wheel,
Hath cast me out the crushing cares
of banishment to feel.
In sceptre proud and haughty crown
f•r thine affyance •aste.
Sith vpsydowne with welkin wheel
whole mounts of wealth is caste.
This princes do possess, that should
their royalty display,
Whose fame shall never ra•ed be
with storm of lowryng day,
To succour those whom misery
in pyt of pains do the •ouse,
To shield and harbour suppliants
in roof of loyal house.
This only brought I from my realm
the precious golden Fleece,
That jewel chief, and eke the flower
of Chivalry in Greece,
The sturdy prop, the romper strong
the bulwark of your wealth,
And Hercul•s the boystrus Imp
of •ove I kept in health.
It was by means of my good will
that Orpheus did escape,
Whose harmony the lyu•le•se rocks
with such delight did rape,
That forced even the clottred lumps
with hobbling pricked to prance,
And eke the ioconde nodding woods
with fotyng fine to dance.
And that those heavenly twins Castor
and Pollux did not dye,
My dew desert is doubled twice,
sith them preserved I.
Of Bores blustering out with puf∣fed
cheeks his blasting breath
His winged sons I kept alive
both Calais and Zeth.
And Linceus that with piercing beams
and sharper sight of eye
Could Nauyes on the farther banks
of Sicill shore espy.
And all the Minions that did come
the golden Fleece to wyn•
As for the Prince of Princes all
I will not bring him in.
With silence Iason will I pa•se,
for whom though him I save,
Yet is not Greece in d•bt to me,
no recompense I crave
To no man him I do impute,
the rest I brough • again
For your avail, that you thereby
some profit might attain.
But only on my Iason dear,
him for my own loves sake
I kept in store, that he of me
his wedded wife should make.
None other fault (God wot) ye have
to charge me with but this,
That Ergo Ship by means of me
returned safely is.
If I a shame fast maid had not
with Cupids bait ben caught•
If more my fathers health to have
then Iasons I had sought,
Pelasga land had been undone,
and fallen to great decay,
The lusty valiant Capytaynes
had clean been cast away:
And jolly Iason first of all
this now thy son in law,
The Bulls had rent his swalowed limbs
in fiery chomping jaw.
Let Fortune fight against my case
as list her eluysh will,
Yet never shall it grieve my heart,
repent my dede I nil,
That I should for so many kings
their relynge honour save,
The guerdon due that I for this
my crime cōmyt must have,
It lies Croon in thy hand,
if thus it likes thee,
Condemn my guilty gohste to death,
but render first to me,
My fault that forced me offend,
then Croon grant I this,
Receiving Ease•n (cause of crime)
I guilty did amiss.
Thou know that I was such an one
when courynge low I lay,
Before thy fete in humble wise
and did entreating pray,
Thy gracious goodness me to grant
some succour at thy hand.
For me a wretch and wretched babes
I ask within this land
Some cottage base, in outcast hole,
some couching corner vile,
If from the town thou drive vs out
to wander in exile,
Then some bye place aloof within
this realm let vs obtain.
¶How I am none that tyrant like
with churlish septer reign,
Nor proudly or disdainfully,
with haughty courage hye,
with vaūting foot do stamp thē down
that vndertroden lye,
And daunted are in careful bale,
this plainly doth disclose,
In that to me of late I such
a son in law have chose,
Who was a wandering pilgrim poor,
with sore afflictions freight,
Dismayed with terror of his foe,
that lay for him in wayght.
Because Acastus having got
the crown of Thessail land,
Requires in thy guilty blood
to bathe his wreackfull hand.
He doth bewail that good old man
his fyble father slain,
Whom wayght of years with bowing back
to stoop allow constrain•
The godly minded sisters, all
yblynde with misty vale
And clokyng colour o• thy craft
dared ventrusly a•sail.
That mount of myfcheife marvelous,
to mangle• •eaw, and cut,
Their fathers dere anointed lym•
In boiling called•on put.
But for thy open gyl•ynes
if thou can purge the same,
Straight •ason can discharge him self
from blot of guilty blame.
His gentle hands were never stained•
with gore of any blood.
Aloof from your con•piracy
refraining far he stood.
His harmless hands put not in •r•
with gory tools to mell.
But thou that se•st on fire first
th•se mighty mischiefs fell,
Whō shameless women's will•e brain•
and manly stomach stout
Doe •et a gog, for to a tempt
to bring all else about.
And no regard at all thou hast,
how scundyng trump of fame
With ringing blast of good or ill
do blow abroad thy name:
Get out and cleanse my •yled realm•
away tog•there b•are
Thine herbs vnmylde of sorcery,
my Lieges rid fro fear.
Transport thee to some other land,
whereas thou may at ease
With odious noise• of dive•lish charm,
the troubled Gods disease.
¶If needs thou will have me avoid,
my ship to me restore,
Or else my mate with whom I first
arrived on this shore:
Why dost thou bid that by my self
I only should be gone?
I came not hither at first without
my company alone.
If this do thee aggryese, that brunt
of wars thou shalt sustain,
Command vs boat• the cause thereof
to shu• thy realm again:
Sith both are guilty of one act,
w•y dost thou partte vs twain?
For Iasons sake, not for mine own,
poor P•lias was slain.
Annex unto my traytrous flight
the conquered booty brave,
My horye headded natural si•r,
whow I forsaken have,
With brothers blody flesh that mang∣led
was with caruynge knife,
Or ought of Iasons forged lies
he gabbes unto his wife.
These dreary deeds are none of mine,
so oft as I offend,
Not for mine own cōmodytie,
to come thereby in the end.
¶time is expierd, by which thou ought
to have been gone away,
With keeping such a cha• why dost
thou make so lunge delay?
¶Yet of thy bounty ere I go.
this one boon will I crave.
Although the mother banished
so sore offended have,
Let not the vengeance of my fault
through wrathful deadly hate,
Mine innocent and guiltless babes
torment in wretched state.
¶Away: with loving friendly grype
thy children I embrace,
And as a father natural
take pity on their case.
¶Even for the prosperus good increase
of fertile spousal bed,
Of Glauce bright thy daughter dear,
whom Iason late hath wed.
And by the hope of fruitful seed,
whose flower in time shall bloom.
By thonour of thy glistering crown•
ythralde to foe•tu•es doom,
Which she so full of chop and change
with tycle turning wheel
Whirls up &amp; down, in staggring state
makes to and fro to reel.
I thee beseech, (sith to exile
I am departing now)
O Croon but a little pause
for mercy me allow,
While of my morning brats with kiss
my last farewell I take.
While gasp of faylyng breath perhap
my shivering limbs forsake.
¶With craft intending some deceit
thou craves this delay.
¶What falsehood for so little time
be cause of terror may?
¶No jot of time is short enough
displeasure to prevent.
¶Can not one jot to weeping eyes
and trilling tears be lent?
¶Although against thy ernest suit
unlucky dread do strive,
One day to settle thee away
content I am to give.
¶This is to much, and of the same
somewhat abridge ye may.
¶Make speed apace if from our land
thou get thee not away,
Ere Phoebus horse with golden glede
their streamyng beams do shed,
Of dawnyng lamp, thou art condemned
to less thy wretched head.
The holy day and bridal both
doe call me hence away:
And wills me at the sacred aare
of Him•nous to pray.
LAui•n of life and dreadlesse was the wight,
Attempt•yng first in slender tot•ring Barge
With slyuyng Ore the sliced wave to smite,
A•d durst commit the dainty tender charge
Of hazered life to inconstant course of wind,
That turns with change of chances evermore,
To view the land for•ok aloof behind•,
And shouyng furthe the s•yp from s•fer shore,
And glancing through the fomy channel deep
On sund•r c•t wych slender stem the wave,
Twy•• hope o• life, and dread of death to sweep,
In narrow gut him self to •pill or save:
Expiry•nc• yet of Planets no man had,
Th•y n•ded not the wandering course• to know
Of Sty•••s, (wherewith •he painted sky is clad,)
Not •l••a•s, (which return of saylyng •••w)
Nor Hyads •that with showrs th• Seas do b•a•e)
No nor the st•rne Amaltheas h•rned •ead
(Who gave the •yppes of luckyng Jove the t•ate)
Were wont to put the blunt•yug shyps in dread.
They feared not the northern icy wayne,
which lazy old boot•s w••lds behind,
A•d twynes about, no name yet could they fain
For Bores rough, nor smother western wind.
Yet Typhys bold on open seas durst sh•we
His hoisted sail•s, and for the winds decree
New laws: as now full gale aloof to blow,
Now tackle turned to take side wind alee,
Now up to fa•le the crossayle on the mast,
Theare safe to hang, the topsail now to spread,
Now missel sail•, and drabler out to cast,
When daglyng hanges his sha•tryng tackle red
while st•a•sman stir, and busy• no••r blyn,
With pyth to pull all sails eke to display,
with tooth and nail all force• of wind to wyn,
To shear the seas, and quick to scud away.
Th• golden world our fathers have possessed,
where •anysht fra•de durst n•u•r come in place,
All were content to live at home in r•st,
with horye head, gray• •eard, and surrowed face.
which tract of time within his con•rey brought,
Rich having little, f•r more they did not toy••,
No vent for wares, nor Traficque far they sought,
No wealth that sprang beyond th•ire natty•e soil,
The Thessail ship together now hath set,
Th• world that w•ll with seas dissevered lay,
It bydd•s the floods with oats to be bet,
And stream•s unknown with shipwreck vs to fray
That wick•d R•le was lost •y ruthful wrack
Ytossed through such perils passing great,
where Scion rocks began roar as thunde• crack,
whose• bouncing bolt th• shaken soil doth bea•,
The sousing surges dasshed eve•y star,
The pe•t•rd seas the clouds aloe•te be•aid,
This scuffling did boule Typhis mind detar,
His h•lme did slyp f•om tree•mblynge hand dismayed.
Then Orpheus with his droop•ng Ha•p was mum
Dead in h•r dumps the •launtyng Argos glee,
All hus•t in rest with silence, w•xed dum,
what hardy heart astound here would no• bee•
To see at once eche yawning mouth to gape,
Of Syllas gulf compact in wa•loyng paunch,
Of dogs, who doth not loath• her mong•ell shape,
H•e visage, br•st, and hyddyous ugly •aunche•
whom irked not the scold with barking styll?
To her• the Mermaids di•e who do•h not quail,
T•at lure the ears with pleasant syngyng ••rill
Of such as on •nsonius sea doe sail?
when Orpheus on his twinkling Harp did play,
That carst the Muse Calliope gave to him
Almost those Nymphs that wonted was to staye
The ship•s, he caused fast following him to swim.
How •early was that wick•d journey bought?
Medea accursed, and eke the golden Flecce,
That greater harm thē storm of s•as hath wrought
Rewarded well that vo•age ••rst of Gre•ce.
Now seas controlled doe suffer passage free,
The •rgo proud erected by the hand
Of Pallas first, doth not com•lain that she,
Conue•d hath back• t•e kings unto their land,
Eche whirty •o•t now scuddes about the deep,
All stints and wears are taken clean away,
The Cities frame new walls them selves to keep,
The open world lets nought res• where it lay:
The •oyes of End Arexes luckwarme leake,
The Pers•ans stout in Rhine and Albis stream
Do bathe •heir barks, •yme ••all in fine out break
when Ocean wave shall open every realm.
The wandrynge world at w•ll shall open lye.
And Typhis will some new found land survey.
Some trailers shall the Co•tree•es far escry•,
Beyond small Thule, known furthest at this day•.
WHy trow•st thou fysking in &amp; out
so rash from place to place?
Stand styll, and of •hyne eager wrath
suppress the ruth•ull race,
The rigour rough of ramping rage
from burning breast out cast,
As Bacchus bedlam priests that of
his spryte have felt the blast,
Run frantic hoytyng up and down
with scytysh wayward wits,
Not knowing any place of rest,
so priest with froward fits,
On cloudy top of Pindus mount
all hyd with snow so chyll:
Or else upon the lofty ridge
of branched Nice hill:
Thus starting still with froūced mind
she walters to and fro,
the signs pronoūcyng prof of pangs
her frenzy face doth show.
with glowing cheeks, &amp; blood red face
with short and gasping breath,
She fetches deep ascending sighs
from sobbing heart beneath.
Now blithe she smiles, each •ōbled thou∣light
in pondering brain she beats,
Now stands she in a mammeryng•
now mischief sore she threats.
w• chafing fume she burns in wrath,
and now she doth complain,
With blubbering tears a fresh believe
she weeps and wails again.
Where will this lumpish load of cares
with headlong swaye alight?
On whom entendethe she to work
the threats of her despite?
Where will this huge tēpestious surge
slake down it self again?
Kindled fury new in breast
begins to boyle a mayne.
She secretly entendes no miss∣chife
small nor mean of syse
To pass her self in wickedness
her busy brains devise.
The token old of pinching ire
full well er this know I:
Sum heinous hog, outrageous great
and dreadful storm is no:
Her fiery, scowling, steaming eyes,
her hanging groin I se,
Her pouting, puffed, frowning face,
that signs of fretting be.
O mighty Ione beguile my fear:
¶O wretch if thou desire,
What measure ought to paise thy wra¦the
then learn by Cupids fire,
To hate as sore as thou did love,
shall I not them annoy
That do unite in spousal bed,
their want on lust enjoy?
Shall Phoebus fiery footed horse
go lodge in western wave
The drdwping day, that la•• I did
with humble crouching crave,
And with such ernest busy suit
so hardly granted was,
Shall it depart er I can bring
my devilish drift to pass?
While hovering heaven doth counter pai∣sed
hang with eagle space,
Amid the marble hemispheres,
while round with stinted race,
The gorgeous sky aboue the earth
doth spinning roll about,
Whiles that the number of the sands,
lies hid unsearched out.
While dawninge day doth keep his course
with Phoebus blase so bright,
While twinkling stars in golden trai∣nes
do guard the s•ombrie night,
While I sie under propping poale
with whirling swyng so swift
The shining bears vnbathed about
The frozen sky do lift,
While flushing •loots y• frothy strea∣mes
to rustling seas do send,
To gird them gript with plonging pangs
my rage shall never end.
With greater heat it shall reboyle,
like as the brutish beast,
Whose tyranny most horrible,
exceeded al the rest,
What greedy gaping whirl poole wide
what parlous gulf vnmild,
What Sylla couched in roaring rocks
or what Charybdes wild,
(That Sicil and Ioinum sea
by frothy waives doth sup)
What Aetna bolking stifling flames,
and dusky vapours up,
(Whose heavy payse with stewyng heat
doth smoldryng crush beneath
Encelades, that fiery flakes
from choked throat doth breath)
Can with such dreadful menaces
In sweating fury fry?
No river swift no troubled surge
Of stormy sea so hye,
Nor sturdy seas (whom rufling winds
with raging force to roar)
Nor puissant flash of fire, whose might
By boysteous blast is more,
May bide my angers violence:
my fury shall it foil:
His court I le over hourl, and lay
it level with the soil.
My Iasons heart did quake for fear
of Croon cruel king•
And lest the king of Thessalye
would war upon him bring.
But loyal love that hardens hearts
makes no man be affright.
But beet, that he conui•t hath yield
him self to Croons might.
Yet once he might have visited•
and come to me his w•fe,
To talk, and take his last farewell.
if danger o• his life
In doing this (harde hearted wretch
most cruel) he should fear,
He being Croons son• in law,
for him it le•u•l were,
To have prorogued somewhat yet
my heavy banishment,
To take my leave of ch•ldren twain
one only day is lent:
Yet do I not complain, as though
the time to short I thought•
As prof shall plain pronoūce, to day,
to day, it shall be wrought,
The memory whereof no tract
of time shall wipe away.
With malice bent against the gods
my wrath shall them assay:
And rifling every thing, both good,
and bad, I will turmoil.
¶Madame thy mind that troubled is,
and •oct with such abroyle
Of swarming ills, thy vexed breast
now set at rest again,
The peevish fond affeccions all
of troubled mind refrain.
¶Then only can I be at rest,
when every thing I see
Thrown headlong topsy turuey down
to ruthful end with me.
With me let al things clean decay:
thy self if thou do spyll,
Thou may drive to destruction
what else with the thou will:
¶If in this folly stiff thou stand
behold what after clappes
Are to be feared, none dare contrive
for princes training trips.
O Luckless lot of froward fates
o cruel fortunes hap,
Both when she list to smite, or spare,
in woe she doth vs wrap
A like, the salve that God hath given
so oft, to cure our grefe,
More noyeth then the sore it self,
and sends less relief:
If for her good desar•es to me
amendment I should make,
I hazard should my venturous life
to less it for her sake.
If I will shun my dismal day
and will not for her die,
Then want the love of loyalty
O wretched man must I.
No dastards dread my stomach• stout
can cause to droop and shrink,
But mere remorse appaulleth me,
when on my babes I think.
For why? when carfull parents are
once reft of life and breath,
Soon after them there wretched seed
are drawn to dolfull death.
O Sacred righteousness (if thou
enjoy thy worthy place
In perfect bliss of happy heaven)
I call upon thy grace,
And the for witness here allege,
how for my childrens part
With pit pricked I have committ
these things against my heart.
And so I think Medea her self
the mother rather had,
(Though francticklye as now she fares
with rage of hart so mad
And doth abhor with painful yoke
of combrous cares to toil)
Her spousal bed, then that her seed
should take the plonging foil.
I did determine in my mind,
to go her to entreat
With gentle words, &amp; pray her cease,
in fervent wrath to fret.
And lo•on me when once she kissed
the beams of glancing eye,
Full blithe she leaps, she iumpes for joy,
in fits she gins to fry.
Deep deadly blackish hate she seems
in out ward brow to bear,
And wholly in her frowning face
doth glutting grefe appear.
¶I packing, packing, Iason am:
this still to chopp, and change
The fletynge soil of my abode,
to me it is not strange.
The cause of my departure yet
(to me is strange) and new.
I wonted was in following the
all places to eschew:
I will depart, and get me hence,
to whom for helping hand
Intend thou to send vs furthe,
whom hence so fly the land
Thou dost compel with thine alies?
shall I repair again
To Phases flood, to Colchis Isle,
or to my fathers reign?
Or gory sweating feldes, that with
my brothers blood do reeke?
What harbring lands aloufe dost tho•
command vs out to seek?
What seas appoint ye me to pa•se?
shall I my i•urney drive,
Upon the parlous hateful jaws
of Pontus to arrive,
By which I did sauf conduct home
kings valaunt armies great,
Where roaring rocks with thundering noise
the flapping waives do beat,
Or on the narrow• wrackful shore,
of Simplegades twain?
Or else to small Hiolcos town
can I return again?
Or toil, y• gladsome pleasant laūds
Of Tempe to attain?
All places that I opened have
Unto thy passage free,
I shut them up against my self,
now whether send thou me?
A banished wretch to banishment
thou would have incline,
Yet to the place of her exile
thou can not her assign.
Yet for all that without delay
I must depart and go:
And why? for sothe the king his son
in law cōmaundeth so.
Well: nothing will I stand against,
with gripes of passing payne
Let me be scourged, of my deserts
such is the gotten gain.
Let Croon in his princely ruff
lay to his heavy hands,
To whip an whore, in torments sharp,
with iron gyves, and bands
Let her be chaynd, in hideous hole
of night for aye her locke:
Let her be cloyed with pestryng payse
of restless rolling rock.
Yet less• than I deserved have,
in all this shall I find:
O thou discourteous Gentleman,
consider in thy mind
The flamye puffs, and fyrye gasps
of ghastly gaping bull,
And Aetas cattle rich with Fleece
of gorgeous golden wool,
That went to graze amid so great
and mighty fears in feylde,
Of uncontrolled nation,
whose soil doth armies yield.
Revoke to mind the deadly darts
of sudden starting foe,
when ghastly warriors (Tellus brood)
to ground again did go
through slaughter red of mutual laūce,
to this yet further pass,
The lurched Fleece of Phrixes Ram,
that all thine errand was.
And vgsome Argos slumberlesse,
whom fast I caused to keep
His weary watching winking eyes
with unacquainted sleep.
My brother eke, whose fatal twist
of feeble life I shred,
And gilt that wrought so many gilts
when as with thee I fled.
The daughters whom I set on work
entrapped in wily train,
To slay their sire, that shall not rise
to quickened life again.
And how to travel other realms,
I set mine own at nought.
By that good hope which of thy seed
conceived is in thought,
Eake by thy stable mention place,
and mighty monsters, that
Down beaten for thy health, I caused
before thy feet to squat,
And by these drudgyng hands of mine
vnspared for thy sake,
For dread of dangers overpass•
that caused thee to quake,
By heavens aboue, and seas below,
that witness bearers be,
To knitting of our marriage up,
thy mercy veil to me.
Of all the heaps of treasure great
so far of being fet,
Which A•tas savage Scythians
did travel for to get,
From End• where Phoebus scorching blase
doth dye the people black.
Of all this gold which in our bowers
we could not well compack,
But tryck and trym we garnished
our groves with gold so gay,
I banished wretch of all this stuff
gat nought with me away,
Except my brothers flaughtred flesh,
yet I employed the same
On thee: the cares of cuntreys health
my honesty and shame.
My father, and my brother both
hath yielded place to •hee,
This is the dowry that thou had
my wedded spouse •o bee.
To her whom thou d•est abrogate
restore her goods again.
¶When Cr•on in malicious mood
had thought thee to have slain,
Entreated with my tear•s exile,
and life he gave to thee.
¶I toke it for a ponyshment,
but surely as I see
This banishment is now become
a friendly good reward.
¶While thou hast time to go be gone,
for most seueare, and harde
The kings displeasure ever is.
¶Thus would thou dodge me out?
Thy hated trull cast of thou doest
that please Creuse thou mought.
¶Doest thou Medea upbraid me with
the breach unkind of love?
¶And slaughter vile with treachery
where thou did me move.
¶When al is done what can thou say
my gyltynes to stain?
¶Even whatsoever I have done.
¶Yet more this doth remain:
That thy vngra•yous wickedness
of harm should •e accuse.
¶Thine, thine, they are, they are al thine
what ever I did use.
Who yt of lewdness reapes the fruit,
is grafter of the same.
Let every one with infamy
thy wretched spouse defame,
Yet doe thou only take her part,
her only doe thou call
A just and undefiled wight,
without offence at all.
If any man shall for thy sake
polute his hand with ill,
To thee let him an innocent
yet be accounted styll.
¶The life is loathsome that doth work
his shame who hath it chose.
¶the life whose choice doth work thy shame
thou ought again to lose.
¶Let reason rule thy eager mind
so vexed with crabbed ire
And for thy tender childrens ease
to be at rest req•ire
¶I do defy it, wholly I
detest it, I forswear,
That brethren bred unto my barnes
Creusas womb shall bear.
¶It will be trym, when as a Queen
of majesty and might
Hath issue, kinn unto the seed
of the a banished wight.
¶So cursed day shall neu•r on
my wretched children shyne
To mingle base borne bastards with
the blood of noble lygne.
Shall Ph•bus stock (that bears y• lamp
of heaven in starry throne)
Be mashed with drudginge Sisi•hus
that roules in hell the stone?
¶What meanest you wretch both the &amp; m•
in banishement to yoke?
I pray thē hence:
¶ When humbly I
my mind to Croon broke,
He gave an ear unto my suit,
¶What lies in my might
To do for the?
¶ If no good turn
then do thy worst despite.
¶On this side with his swerd in hand
King Croon doth me scar:
On other part with armed host
Assist doth me deter.
¶Medea eke to coape with these,
that more opal vs may:
Go to, to skirmish let vs fall
Let Ease•n be the pray:
¶I yield whom sore adversities
have tyerd with heavy swaye.
Learn thou to dred thy luclesse lost
that oft doth thee assay.
¶ I evermore have ruled the swinge
of fortunes wavering will.
¶Achastus is at hand and nigh
is Croon the to spyll:
¶Take y• thy heles to scope them both,
I do not the advise,
That thou against thy father in law
In traytrous arms should rise.
Nor in Achas• thy c•sens blood
thy wounding hands to gore,
The vol•es unto Medea made,
do trouble the so •ore.
While yet y• hast not spylt there blood
yet, fly, with me a way.
¶when armies twain their banners o•
Defiance shall display,
And marching •earth in fylde to fight
s•ke battle at my hand,
Who then for vs encounter shall
their puyssa•ce to withstand?
¶If Cr•on and Acastus king
encamp to gether shall•
Admit that these in one with them
should join there powers all
My Contreymen of Cholchis Isle,
and A•tas lusty king,
Suppose the Scythians join with Greeks,
to ground I will them bring,
Clean put to foil.
¶The puissant power
of haughty mace I fear
¶Take heed, lest more thou do office•e
the same, then for to clear,
Thy self of Croons servile yoke,
¶Least some suspicion grow.
Of this our tattling long here let
vs make an end and go.
¶Now Jove hurl out thy flames and
thy thundering •olts to fly,
With fiery drakes bright brandishing force
dispersed in burning sky:
Strain furth thy dreadful threatening arm,
dispose in due array
The tossing dynt of lightning flash,
that wreck our quarrel may.
With rumbling crack of renting cloud
cause all ye world to quake,
And level not thy hovering hand
to strike with fyrye flake
Upon my poshed and crushed corpse,
or Iasons carcass slain:
For whether of vs thou smite to death
his dew reward shall gain,
thy thumps of thwacking bolts on vs
amiss they cannot light.
¶Fie, let thy mind on matters run
that seem a modest wight.
And use to have more cheerful talk,
if any thing thou crave,
Within my fathers house to ease
thy flight, thou shalt it have.
¶thou know my mind both can, &amp; eke
is wont, to do no less,
Then to contemn the bryttell wealth
that Princes do possess.
This, this shall be the only boon
that at thy hand I crave,
As mates with me in banishment,
my children let me have,
That resting on their sighing breasts
my careful morning head,
I may my crystal ••aria streams
into their bosoms shed.
But as for thee, new gotten sons
of wife new wed do staye.
¶ I grant that unto thy request
I wysh I might obeye:
But nature me with pytye pricks,
that needs I must deny.
For though both Croon and Achast,
in torments force me lye,
I could not yield unto their wills:
on this my life doth rest:
In times of tears, this is the joy
of dull afflicted breast
For better far I can abide
the want of vital breath,
And succour of my limbs, or loose,
the light of world by death.
¶What love unto his sly babes
is deeply graft in him?
This works well I have him trypt•
lo now there lies brim.
An open place whereby receive
a venue soon he may.
Let me or I depart, unto
my sly children say.
These lessons of my last adieu,
and grant to me the space,
With tender grype of colling last
their loving limbs •embrace:
This will be comfort to my heart:
yet at the latter wo•rde
I ask nomore but only that
you should me this afoorde.
If eager anguish cause my tongue
to cast out words unkind,
Let al thing fly, let nothing be
Engraved in your mind
But let rem•mbrau•ce otherwhyle
of me to touche your thought,
Let other things be wiped away
that bile of wrath hath wrought.
¶I have forgotten every whit
god grant thou may of shake
These surging qualms of frownced mind
&amp; milder may it make:
For quietness doth work their ease
that dented are with woe:
¶What is he slyl•e slypt and gon?
falls out the matter so?
O Iason doest thou sneak away,
not having mind of me,
Nor of those former great good turns
that I have done for the?
With the now am I clean forgot:
but I will bring about
That from thy careful sighing mind
shall not be banished out:
Apply to bring this to effect,
call home thy wits again,
And all thy wily fetches far,
each artificial train.
This is the perfect fruit that may
to the of mischief spring,
To presuppose that mischief is
not graft in any thing.
Scante have I oportunyt•e
for my pretensed guile,
Because we are mistrusted sore,
But try I will the while
To set upon them in such sort,
as none can deem my slight:
Marche furth, now venture on, fall to,
both what lies in thy might,
And also what doth pass thy power.
O faith full nurse and mate.
Of all my heavy hart breaking,
and divers cursed fate,
Come help our simple mean device.
remaining yet I have
A robe of Pall the present that
our heavenly grandsire gave,
Chief monument of Cholchis Isle,
which Phoebus did bestow
On Etas for a pledge, that him
his father h• might know.
A precious fulgent gorget eake,
that bravely glitters bright,
And with a seemly shining seam
of golden thirds is dyght,
Through wrought between the row of pirles
do stand in borders round
Wherewith my golden crispen lockes
is wonted to be crounde.
My little children they shall bear
these presents to the Bride,
That first with slybber ••abhor sosse
of chauntmentes shall be tried.
Request the aid of Hecate
in readiness prepare
The lamentable sacrifice,
upon the bla•dye Aare.
Enforce the fierce catching hold
upon the rafters hye
With crackling nois of flame sparks
rebound in azure sky.
NO fierce force, nor rumb•yng cage
of boysteous blustering wind,
No dart shot why•ling in the skies•
such terror to the mind
Can drive, as when the •re•ull wife
doth boyle in burning hate,
Deprived of her spo•sall bed,
and comfort of her mate,
Nor where the stormy southern wind
with dankysh dabbye face,
Of horye winter sends out
the gushing shooores apace.
where veighment Esters rambling stream
comes walterynge down amain,
Forbidding both the banks to me••e,
and canoe• oft contain
Him self w•thin his channels scou•e,
but further breaks his way,
Nor Rodanus who•e rushing stream
doth launch into the sea,
Or when amid the floured spring
with hotter burning son,
The winters snows disolued with heate
down to the rivers run:
The clottred top of Haemus hill
to water thynne doth turn,
Such desperate gogyn flame is wrath
that inwardly doth burn,
And modest rule regards not,
nor bridals can abide,
Nor dreading death, doth wysh on di•te
of naked blade to slyde.
O Gods be gracious unto vs,
for pardon we do crave,
That him who tamed the scuffling waives,
vouchsafe ye would to save.
But Neptune yet the Lord of S•as
with frowning face will lower,

MY shivering mind amazed is,
aghast, and sore dismayed:
My chyllysh limbs with quaking cold
doe tremble all afraid.
Such plagues &amp; vengeance is at hand
in what exceeding wise
Do sharpe assaults of greedy grief
styll more and more arise,
And of it self in smothering breast
enkyndles greater heate?
Oft have I seen how ramping rage
hath forced her to fret.
With frantickfyts, mad, bedlam wise
against the Gods to rail,
And eke bewitched gohstes of heaven
in plunging plagues to trail:
But now Medea beats her bu∣sie
brain to bring to pass
A mischief greater, greater far,
then ever any was.
Ere while when hence she trypt away
astonished so sore,
And of her poison closet close
she entered had the door:
She powers out her jewels all,
abroad to light she brings
That which she dreading loathed long,
most irksome ugly things:
She mumbling conjures up by names
of ills the rabble rowte,
In hugger mugger couched lunge,
kept close, unsearched out:
All pestlent plagues she calls upon,
what ever Libie land,
In frothy boiling stream doth work,
or muddy belching sand:
What teryng torments Taurus bredes,
with snows vnthawed styll
Where winter flaws, and hory frost
knit harde the craggy hill,
She lays her crossing hands upon
each monstrus coniurd thing,
And over it her magic verse
with charming doth she singe:
A mousy, rowsye, rusty route
with cankered scales y•lad
From musty, fusty, dusty dens
where lurked lunge they had,
Do •roll: a walowing •arpent hog
his combrous corps out draggs,
In fiery foaming blaring mouth
his forked tongue he wags.
He stares about with sparkling eyes,
if some he might espy,
Whom snapping at with stinging spit
he might constrain to dye:
But hearing once the magic uerse
he hushed as all a gast,
His body boalne big, wrapped in lumps
•n twining knots he cast.
And rambling to and fro his tail
in links he row•es it round.
Not sharp enough (quoth she) y• plages
and tools that hollow ground
Engenders for my purpose are,
to heaven up will I call,
To reach me stronger poison down,
to frame my fea• with all.
Now is it at the very point,
Medea thou assay.
To bring about sum farther fetch,
then common wishes may.
Let down, Let down, that sprawling snake
that doth his body spread,
As doth a running broke abroad
his mighty channel shed.
Whose swelling knobs of wondrous sis
&amp; boysteus bobbing bumps
Doth thumpe the great &amp; lesser bear
that feel his heavy lumps.
The bigger bear with golden glede
the greekishe fleet doth guide:
But by the less the Sidon ships
their passage have espied.
He that with pinch of griping fist
doth bruise the adders twain,
His strenyng harde &amp; clasping hand,
let him vnknitt again.
And crush thair squeezed venom out,
com further thou our charm
O flymie serpent Python, whom
dame Iuno sent to harm
Diana and Apollo both,
(those heavenly spirits twain)
With whom Latona travelling
did groan with pinching payne.
O Hydra whom in Lerna poole
Alcides gave the foil,
And all the noisome vermin vile
that Hercules did spoil.
Which when on sunder they were cut
with slicing deadly knife,
Can knit again there sodred parts,
and so recover life.
Help wakeful Dragon Argos• whom
first magic words of mine
Made Morpheus locke thy sleppe lids
and shut thy slurgynge even.
Then having brought aboue the groūd
of serpents all the row•e,
Of filthy wedes the ranckest bane
she pyckes. and gathers out,
That spring on know•tie Eryx hill
where passage none is found,
Among the ragged rocks, or what
on Caucasus his ground
Doth grow that styll is clad in cote
of horye mori frost.
That evermore vnmelt abides,
whose spattred fylde is soste
With g•bbs of blood, yt spowteth from
Prometheus gaping maw,
Whose guts with twitching talēt out
the gastlye grype doth draw.
Or any other venomous herb
among the Medes that grows,
that with their sheaf of arrows sharp
in fylde do scar their foes.
Or what the light held Parthian
to serve her turn can send,
Or else the rich Arabians,
that dyp their arrows end
In poison •tronge: the joyce of all
Medea o•t doth wring,
That underneath the frozen poale
In swe•in land doth spring.
Whose noble state Hircinus wood
do the high enhance and rear.
Or what the plea•aūte soil doth yield
in pryme of smiling vere,
When nature bids the bird begin
her shrouding nest to build,
Or when the chursyshe Bores blast
sharpe winter hath exiled,
The trym array of branch and bough
to cloth the naked tree,
And every thing with bitter could
of snow con•ealed be.
In any pestilent flower on stalk
of any herb doth grow,
Or noisome joyce doth lie in rot∣ten
writhen rotes allow,
Hath any force in breadyng bane,
those takes she in her hand.
Sum plagye herbs did Ethos yield
that mount of Thessayle land.
And other Pindus roches hye
and sum upon the top
Of Pingeus, but tender twigs
the cruel since did l•pp:
These Tigris river noryshte up,
that chokes his whyrlpoale deep
With stronger stream. Danubius those
in fostryng wave did keep.
Those did Hidaspus minister,
who by the parching zone
With luke warm silver chanel runes,
so rich with precious stone.
And Bethis son, who gave the name
unto his country great,
And with his shallow fourd against
the Spanish seas doth beat
This herb abode the edge af knife
in danwnynge of the day
Or Phebus face began pepe, bedecte
with glittering golden spraye
His slender stalk was snepped of
in deep of sylent night,
His corn was cropped, while she with charm
her po•sned nails did dight.
She chops the deadly herbs, &amp; wrings
the squeezed clottered blood
Of serpents out: &amp; filthy birds
of irksome merry mud:
She tempers with the same and eake:
She brays the heart of owl
Foreshewing death with glaring eyes
and moapyng visage foul
Of shr•ke whole hoarse alive she takes
the dirty stinking guts,
Al these the framer of this feat
in divers parcels puts.
This hath in it devouring force
of greedy spoiling flame,
The frozen eysye dulling could
engenders by the same.
She chantes on those ye magic verse,
that works no lesser harm,
With bustling frātickelie she stamps,
and cease not to charm.
O Flittring flocks of grisly gostes
that sit in sylent seat
O ougsum buggs o goblins grym
of hell I you entreat:
O lowryng Chaos dungeon blind,
and dreadful darkened pytt,
Where Ditis muffled up in clouds
of blackest shades doth sytt,
O wretched woeful wawlyng souls
your eyed I do implore,
That linked lie with jingling chains
on wailing Limbo shore,
O mo•sye den where death doth couch
his ghastly carrayn face:
Releas your pangs o spryghtes, &amp; to
this wedding hye apace.
Cause ye the snaggye whele to pause
that rentes the carcass bound,
Permit Ixions racked limbs
to rest upon the ground:
Let hungry bitten Tantalus
with gawnt and pined paunch•
Soup up Pirenes gulped stream
his swelling thirst to stawnche.
Let burning Croon bide the brunt
and girds of greater payne,
Let payse of slippery sliding stone
type over back again
His moylynge father Sisyphus,
amongst the craggy rocks.
Ye daughters dire of Danaus
Whom pierced pychers morkes
So oft with labour lost in vain
this day doth long for you
That in your life with bloody blade
at once your husband slew.
And thou whose aares I honoured have
o torch and lamp of night,
Approach o lady mine with most
deformed visage dyght:
O three fold shapen dame that knitst
more threatening brows then on,
Acco•dyng to the country guise
with daglyng lockes undone
And naked foot, the secrete grove
about I halowed have,
From dusky dry vnmoystye clouds
the showers of rain I crave.
Through me ye chinked gaping ground
the soked seas hath drunk,
And mayner stream of thocian flood
beneth the earth is sunk,
that swelteth out through hollow gulf
with stronger gushing rage.
Thē were his suddy rambling waives
whose power it doth assuage
the heavens with wrong disturbed course
and out of order quyte,
The darkened son, &amp; glīmering stars
at once hath showed their light,
and drēched Charles his straggling wane
hath ducte in dashing wave,
The framed course of roamyng time
racte out of frame I have.
So my enchaūtments have it wrough•
that when the flaming son
In sōmer bakes the parched soil
then hath the twigs begone,
with sprouting blossom fresh to blome'
and hasty winter corn
Hath out of harvest scene the fruit
to barnes on sudden borne.
Into a shallow ford his stur
dystreame hath Phases wast
And Esters channel being in
so many branches cast,
Abated hath his wrackful waives,
on every sylent shore
He lies calm: The jumbled flooddes
with th•ndryng noise did roar,
When couched close the winds were
not moving pipp•ing soft,
With working wave the prancing seas
have swollen &amp; leapt aloft,
Whereas the wood in alder time
with thyck and branched bow
did spread his shade on gladsome soil
no shade remains now.
I rolling up the magic verse
at noon time Phaebu• staye,
Amid the darkened sky, when fled
was light of drowsy day
Eke at my charm the watery flocks
of H•yads went to glade.
Time is it Phaeba to respect
the service to thee made:
To thee with cruel bloody hands
these garlands grene were twinned
Which with his folding circles nine
the serpent rough did bind.
Have here Tipho•as flesh, that doth
In Etnas furnace groan,
That shake with battery violent
king Ioues assalted trone.
This is the Centaurs poisoned blood
which Nessus vilely•no vile
Who made a rape of Dianire
intending her to fyle,
Bequeathed her when newly woūde
he gasping lay for breath,
While Hercles shaft stack in his ribs,
whose lawnce did work his death:
B•hold the funeral cinders hear
which up the poison dried
Of Hercul•s who in his fire
on Oeta mountain dyed:
Lo here the fatal brand, which late
the fatal sisters three
Conspired at Mel•agers birth,
such should his destnye be,
To save alive his brethyng corpse,
while tha• might hole remain,
Wh•che safe his mother Alto kept,
till he his uncles twain,
(That from Atlanta would have had
the head of Conquered Bore,)
Had reft of life whose spiteful death
Althea toke so sore,
That both she showed her feruentnes
in sisters godly lous,
When to revenge her brothers death
mere nature did her move,
But yet as mother most unkind
of nature most vnmylde,
To hasten the untimely grave
of her beloved child,
While Mel•ages •atoll brand
she wasted in the flame,
Whose swelting guts &amp; bowels moult
consumed as the same,
These plumes the Harpies ravening fowls
for hast did leave behind,
In hidden hole whose close access
no mortal wight can find.
When fast from Zeds chasing them
with spedye flight they fled.
Put unto these the feathers which
the Stymphall bird did shed,
Whom ducking Phoebus dymned light
sir Hercules did sting,
And galled with the shaft, that he
in Hydras hyde did fling.
You Aares have yield a clattryng noise
I know, I know of old,
How unto me my Oracles
are wonted to be could,
That when the trembling flower doth shake
then hath my Goddess great,
Uouchfafe to grant me my request
as I did her entreat.
I see Dianas waggyn swyfe,
not that whereon she glides
When all the night in darkened sky
with face full op she rides:
with coūtenaūce bright &amp; blandishyng
but when with heavy cheer,
With dusky shīmering winnie globe,
her lamp doth pale appear.
Or when she trots about the heavens•
with horsehead rayned strait,
When Thessayle witches with the threats
of c•arming her doe bait.
So with thy dumpysh dulled blase,
thy cloudy fainting light,
Send out, amid the lowryng sky,
the heart of people smite
With agonies of sudden dread,
in strange and fearful wise,
Compel the precious brazen pannes
with iarryng noise to rise
Through Corinth country every where,
to shield the from this harm,
lest headlong drawn thou be frō h•auen
to earth by force of charm.
An holy solemn sacrifice
to worship the we make,
Imbrewed with a bloody turphe
the kindled torch doth take
Thy sacred burning night fire at
the dampishe more grave.
Sore charged with thy troubled ghost
my head I shaken have,
And du•king down my neck allow
with shrieking load have shright,
And grovelling flat on floor in traūce
have lain in dead mans plight.
My tuffled lockes about mine ears
down daglyng have ben bound
Tuckt up about my temples twain
with gladsome garland •round:
A dreary branch is offred the
from filthy stigis flood.
As is the guise of Bacchus prestos
the Coribanthes wood,
With naked breast and dugs laid out
Isle prick with sacred blade
Mine arm, that for the bubbling blood
an issue may be made,
with trilling streams my purple blood
let drop on Thalter stones:
My tender childrens crushed flesh
and broken broosed bones
Learn how to brooke with hardened heart•
in practyse put the •rade
To flourish fearce, and keep a coil,
with naked glittering blade:
I spryncl•d holy water have,
the lance once being made,
If tyred thou complain that
my cries thee ouerlade,
Give pardon to my ernest suit,
o Perceus sister dear,
Styll Iason is the only cause
that urges me to rear
with squeaking voice thy noisome beams,
that sting like shot of bow.
So season thou those sawced robes
to work Creusas woe,
Wherwt when she shall prank her self•
the poison by and by
To rot her in ward mary out,
within her bones may fry,
The secret fire bleares their eyes
with gloss of yellow gold,
The which Prometheus gave to me
that fire fylcher bold.
On whom for robbery that he did
in heavens aboue commit,
With massy payse great Caucasus
thunweldye hill doth sit,
Where under with vnwasted womb
he lies, and pays his pain,
To feed the crāmyng foul with gubbes
of guts that grows again.
He taught me with a pretty sleyght
of conning, how to hyde
The strength of fire close kept in,
that may not be espied,
This lively tinder Mulciber
hath forged for my sake,
That tempered is with brimstone quick
at first touche and take.
Eke of my cousin Phacton
a wyld fire flake I have
His flames the monstrous stagharde rough•
Chimera to me gave,
In head and breast a Lyon grimm,
and from the rump behind
He swepes the flower with laggyng tail
of Serpent force by kind.
In ribs &amp; loins along his paunch
yshaped like a Got.
these fumes that out the bull perbrakt•
from fyrye spewing throat,
I gotten have and brayd it with
Medusas bitter gall
Cōmaundyng it in secret sort
to dusk and cover all:
Breath on these venoms Hecate
with deadly might inspire,
Preserve the touching poulder of
my secret covert fire,
O grant that these my cloaked crafts
so may bewitch their eyes,
That likelihood of treason none
that may herein surmise:
So work that they in handling it
may feel no kind of heate:
Her stewing breast, her seething veins,
let fervent fire fret
And force her roasted pynyg limbs,
to drop and melt away,
Let smoke her rotten broiling bones:
inflame this bride to day
To caste a light with greater glede
on fryseled blasynge hear
Then is the shining flame that doth
the wedding torches bear.
My suit is harde, thryse Hecate
a dreadful barking gave
From doleful cloud a sacred flash
of flamye sparks she drove.
Each poisons pride fulfilled is:
Call furthe my children dear,
By whom unto the cursed Bride
these presents you may bear:
Go furthe, go furthe my little babes,
your mothers cursed fruit,
Go, go, employ your pains with bribe
and earnest humble suit
To purchase grace, and eke to earn
you favour in her sight.
That both a mother is to you,
and rules with Ladies might.
Go on, apply your charge apace
and hye you home again,
That with embracing you I may
my last farewell attain.

with ysie dulling cold conieald
my members all benum.
My shivering limbs appalled sore
for ghastly fear do quake,
A•d banished rage of malice hot
begins it self to flake:
The hateful hart of wife against
her Spouse hath yielded place,
And piteous mothers mercy mild
restores natures face.
O shall I shed their guiltless blood?
shall I the frame unfold
Of that, which loving natures hand
hath wrought in me her mould?
O dotty•g fury change thy mind,
conceive a better thought,
Let not this heinous savage dede
by means of me be wrought.
What crime have they (poor fools) cōmit
for which they should aby?
Upon their father Iason right
all blott of blame should lye.
Medea yet their mother I
am worser far then he
Tush let them frankly go to wrack,
no kith nor kin to me
They a•: dispatch them out of hand
hold, hold• my babes they be
God wot most harmless lambs they are,
no crime nor fault have they
Alas they be mere innocents
I do not this denay:
So was my brother whom I slew:
o false revolting mind
Why doest thou staggryng to and fro
such change of fancies find?
Why is my face be sprint with tears
what makes me falter so,
That wrath &amp; love with striving though¦htes
do lead me to and fro?
Such fighting fancies bickering stor¦mes
my swaruyng mind detar,
As when between ye wrestling winds
is raised wrangling war,
Eche where the tumbling walloinge waives,
are hoist and reared hye
Amid the jostling swolues of seas
that what in •urye fry:
Even so my hart with struggling thoughts
now sinks, now swells ama•n,
Wrath sometime chase virtue out
and virtue wrath again.
O yield the yield, a grysyng grefe,
to virtue yield th• place:
Thou only comfort of our stock
in this afflicted case,
Come hither comdere loved imp
with colling me embrace,
While that by me your mother dere
sweet Boys ye are enjoyed
So lunge god grant your father may
you keep from harm vncloyd
Exile and flight approach on me,
And they shall by and by
Be pulled perforce out of mine arms,
with vapourd weeping eye
Sore languishing with moorning hart
yet let them go to grave
Before •heir fathers face as they
before their mothers have:
Now rancorus grefe with fiery fits
begins to boyle again,
The quenched coals of deadly hate
do fresher force attain.
The rusty rancour harbred lunge
within my cankered breast
Starts up, and stirs my hand anew
in mischief to be pressed.
O that the rabblement of brattes
which swarmde about the side
Of Niobe that scornful dame
who perished by her pride
Had taken life out of his limbs.
o that the fates of heaven
A fruitful mother had me made
of children seven and seven.
My barren womb •or my revenge
hath yielded little store
Yet for my sire and brother, twain
I have, their needs no more:
whō seek this ruffling rowt of fiends
with gargell visage dyght;
Where will they deal their stripes, or whom
with whips of fire smite?
Or whom with cruel scorching brand
and Stygian faggot fell,
with mischief great to cloy, entendes
this army black of hell?
A choppyng Adder began to hiss
with wrethynges wrapped round,
As soon as did the lashing whip
••art out with yerkyng sound.
whom bumping with thy rapping post
Megeta wilt thou crush?
whose ghost doth here mishapped frō hell
with scattered members rush?
My slautred brothers ghost it is
that vengeance coms to crave:
According to his dire request
due vengeance shall he have.
But flap thou fearce the fierbrandes
full dasshed in mine eyes,
Dig, rent, scrape, burn, &amp; squea• thē out
lo op my breast it lies,
To fighting furies bobbing strokes
O brother, brother bid
These roils, y• press to worry me,
them selves away to rid.
Down to the silent souls allow
Not taking any care:
Let me be left hear by my self
alone, and do not spare.
To bast, and capperclaw these arms
that drew the blody blade:
To quench the furies of thy sprite,
that thus do me invade,
With this rig•t hand the sacrifice
on thalter shall be made.
What means this sudden trampling noise?
a band of men in Arms
Come bustling toward vs, that m•
will cloy with •eadly harms.
To end this slaughter set •ppon
I will my self convey
Up to the garrets of our house,
come Nurse with me away,
Bestow thy body hence with me
from danger of our foes.
Now thus my mind on mischief set
thou must thy self dispose,
Let not the flickering fame &amp; praise
in darkness be exiled
Of stomach stout• that you did use
in murdering of thy child.
Proclaim in peoples ears the praise
of cruel blodye hand.
¶If any faithful man here be,
whom ruin of his land,
And slaughter of his prince do cause
in pensive heart to bleed,
step furth that ye may take the wretch
that wrought this deadly dede.
Hear, hear, ye jolly champions
lay lode with weapons hear,
Have now, hoist up this house, frō low
foundation up it rear.
¶Now, now my sceptre guilt I have
recovered once again:
My fathers wrongs revenged are,
and eke my brother slain:
The gouldens cattels Fleece returned
is to my native land,
Possession of my realm I have
reclaimed to my hand:
Come home is my vi•gynitie,
that meanwhile went a straye.
O Gods as good as I could wish,
o joyful wedding day,
Go shroud thy self in darkness dim
dyspacht I have this feat:
Yet vengeance is not done enough,
to cool our thrystye heate.
O soul why dost thou make delay?
why dost thou doubting stand?
Go foreword with it yet thou may,
while doing is thy hand:
The wrath that might should minister
doth qualify his flame:
The pricks of sorrow twitch my heart
attaint with blushing shame:
Through rigour of thy heinous gore
o wretch what hast thou done?
Though I repent a caitiff vile
I am, to slay my son:
Alas I have committed it,
importunate delight,
Styll egged on my froward mind
that did against it fight:
And lo the vain coniecte of this
delight increases styll,
This only is the thing, that wants
unto my wicked will,
That Iasons eyes should see this sight
as yet I do suppose
Nothing it is that I have done,
my travel all I lose,
That I employed in dyry deeds,
unless he see the same.
¶Lo hear she looks out, and leanes
upon the houses frame,
That pitchlong hanges with falling sway:
hear heap your fierce fast,
Whereby the flames that she her self
kindled, may her wast.
¶Go Iason, go the o••• rights
the winding sheet and grave
Make ready for thy sons, as last
behooves him to have,
Thy spouse and eke thy father in law
that are entomde by me
Received have the duties that
to ded men's ghosts agree.
This child hath felt the deadly stroke
and lance of fatal knife,
And this with wall•some murder like
shall lose her tender life.
¶By all the sacred ghosts of heaven,
and by thy oft exile,
And spousal bed, with breach of love
in me did not defile,
Now spare, and sa•e the life of him
my child and also thine:
What ever crime committed is,
I grant it to be mine•
Make me a blodie sacri•ice
to dew deserved death,
Take from my sinful guilty head
the use of vital breath.
¶Nay sith thou will not have it so
as grieves thy pinched mind,
Here way to wreck my vengeaūce •ell
my burning blade shall find.
Anaunt, now hence thou peasant proud
employ thy busy payne,
To reap the fruits of virgins bed,
and cast them of again
whē mothers they are made.
¶let one
for dew revenge suffice.
If greedy thryste of hungry hands
that still for vengeance cries,
Might quenched be with blood of one
then ask I none at all,
And yet to stanch my hungry grief
the number is to small,
If only twain I slay, if pledge
of love lye secret made,
My bowels Isle vnbreste and search
my womb with poking blade.
¶Now finish out thy deadly deed,
that enterprised is,
No more entry•ounce will I use,
yet only grant me this,
Delay a while his doleful death,
that I may take my flight.
Least that mine •yes with bledyng heart
should view that heavy sight.
¶Yet linger eager anguish yet
to slay this child of thine.
Run not to rash with hasty speed
this doleful day is mine:
The •yme that we obtained have
of Croon, we enjoy.
¶O vile malicious minded wretch
my loathsome life destroy.
¶In craving this thou speak, that I
should show thee some relief,
Well goodynough, all this is done:
o ruthful giddy grief,
This is the only sacrifice
that I can thee provide,
Unthankful Iason hither caste
thy coyesh looks aside.
Lo hear dost thou behold thy wife?
thus ever wonted I,
When murder I had made, to scope,
my way doth open lye
That I may spring into the skies•
the flying serpents twain
Submitted have their s•aly necks
to y•ke of rattling wayne,
Thou father have thy sons again
I in the wandering sky,
In nimble wheled waggyn swift
will ride advanced hye.
¶Go through the ample spaces wide,
infect the poisoned air•,
Bear witness grace of God is none
in place of thy repair.

NOw that Juror with glittering streams,
The gliding stars from sky doth chase,
Sir Phoebus pert, with spouting beams,
From dewy nest doth mount a pace:
And with his cheerful looks doth yéelde,
Unto the world a gladsome day.
Go to, O wretch, with ample field
Of heavy cares, oppressed aye,
Thy grievous wonted plaints recount:
Doe not alone with sighs and howls,
The seaysh Alcyones surmount,
But also pass the Pandyon fowls:
More irksome is thy state than theirs.
O mother dear, whose death by fits
I nyl lament, but styll shed tears,
My ground of grief in thée it sits.
If that in shades of darksome den,
Perceiving sense at all remain,
Hear out at large, O Mother, then,
My great complaints, and grievous payne.
O that immortal Clothos wrist,
Had torn in twain my vital thredde:
Ere I, unto my grief, had wist
Thy wounds, and face of sanguine red.
O day, which aye doth mée annoy:
Since that time, did I more desire,
The fearful darkness to enjoy,
Than Phoebus fresh with fair attire.
I have abode the bitter hest
Of stepdame dire, in Mothers place,
I have abode his cruel breast,
His stomach stout, and fighting face.
She, she for spyte unto my case,
A doleful, and a grave Eryn,
To Bridegrooms chamber spousal space,
The Stygian flashing flames brought in.
And thée, alas, most piteous sire,
With traytrous trains hath shée bereft
Of breathing soul with poisoned mire:
To whom ere while, the world all left
Unvanquished from the Ocean Seas,
By martial feats did fréely yield:
And did subdue with wondrous ease,
The Britain brutes that fled the field:
Whom living at their propre swaye,
No Romaine power did erst invade.
Now lo (full well lament I may)
Thy spouse deceit thy prowes hath lade:
And now thy court, and child of yore,
With homage serve a Tyrants lore.
WHom so the glistening pomp of royal place,
With soden sight ynumd doth quite disgrace,
Who so at courtly fléeting ebbing blase,
Astonished sore, himself doth much amass:
Lo sée of late the great, and mighty stock,
By lurking fortunes sudden forced knock,
Of Claudius quyte subvert and clean extinct:
Tofore, who held the world in his precinct:
The Britain Ocean coast that long was frée,
He ruled at will, and made it to agrée
Their Romaine Galleys great for to embrace.
Lo he that Tanais people first did chase,
And Seas unknown to any Romaine wight,
With lusty sheering ships did ouerdight,
And safe amid the savage freakes did fight,
And rufling surging Seas hath nothing dread,
By cruel spouses gilt doth lye all dead.
His son likewise more fiend than Tiger fierce,
Of natural Mother makes a funeral hearse.
Whose Brother drenched déepe, with poisoned cup
Poor Britannic, his senseless soul gave up.
Octauia sister, and unhappy make,
Doth sore lament his case for Britanus sake:
No can his ruthful piteous sorrow slake,
Though Neros wrath do sore constrain his grace.
Shée nill esteems the secret closet place:
But boiling still with equal peysde disdain,
With mutual hate against him doth burn again.
My true and trusty love, that I do bear,
In vain I sée doth strive to comfort her.
Revenging gréedie grief doth straight reprive,
T'appease his smart, the counsel that I give.
Nor flame of worthy breast doth once relent:
But heaps of grief, his courage do augment.
Alas, what grisly déedes for to ensue
My fear foreséeth: God grant it be not true.
O Staggering state, O peerless ill:
With ease Electra I repeat,
And call to mind thy mourning will.
With watered eyes, like smartiug sweat,
Thou might lament thy father slain,
Still hoping that thy brother might,
That deadly déede revenge again.
Whom thou O tender loving wight,
Did safely shield from bloody foe,
And natural love did closely kéepe:
But Neroes dreaded visage lo,
Doth fear me that I dare not wéepe,
Nor whale my parents ruthful case,
By cruel lot to slaughter caught:
No suffers me this genial face,
To dash with tears, too dearly bought
With brothers blood: who only was
Mine only hope in all my grief,
And of so many mischiefs, as
My comfort great, and sole relief.
Now lo reserved for greater care,
And to abide more lingering payne,
Of noble famous lynage bare,
A drooping shade I doe remain.
My Ladies heavy voice me thought,
Within my listening ears began sound.
And snaylish age in going soft,
Unto his thews is not ybounde.
O Nurse our dolours witness sure,
By curroll chéekes distilling rain,
And heavy hearts complaint, endure.
Alas what day shall rid of payne,
With care your well no wasted hart?
That sends this guiltless ghost to grave.
This talk good Madame set apart.
In rule my state the destnies have,
And not thy prayers, O Matron just.
The down soft easy God shall give,
Your troubled mind, a time, I trust,
More swéete than ever you did live.
With feuell fair, as one content,
And glossed face, but only please
Your man, and make, he will relent.
The Lion fierce I shall appease,
And sooner tame the Tiger stout,
Than mankind tyrants brutish breast.
He spites the noble raced route,
Contemns high powers, dysdaynes the least:
No can well use that princely wéede,
Which venomous parent wrapped him in
By huge unspeakable grisly déede.
Although that wight unthankful, grin
In Kingly throne, that he doth reign,
Through cruel cursed mothers aid:
Although he pay with death again
So great a gift, it shall be said,
And after fates in long spent age,
That woman wight shall have always,
This elegy yet, and saying sage,
That he by his doth bear the sway.
Let not your ragious mind so walk,
But doe compresse your moody talk.
THough much I bear ye boiling breast do beat,
And tolerably take deuorcements threat,
Deaths only deadly dart, I sée an end,
Of all my broil &amp; pinching payne can send.
What pleasant light to me, O wretch is left,
My natural Mother slain, and Sire bereft,
Of breathing life, by treason, and by gilt:
Of Brother eke deprived: with miseries spilt:
And wailing overcome: kept down with care,
Envied of Make, which I dare not declare.
To maiden subject now, and now defied:
What pleasant light can me, O wretch, abide
With fearful heart suspecting always ought:
Because I would, no wicked déede were wrought:
Not that I fear Deaths grisly girning face,
God grant I doe not so revenge my case?
A better déede to dye: for, to behold
The Tyrants visage grimm, with brows vprolde,
And with soft tender lips, my foe to kiss,
And stand in awe of becks, and notts of his,
Whose will to please, my grief with cares yfirde,
Since brothers death by wicked while conspired,
Could never once vouchsafe for to sustain,
Less grief to die, than thus to live in payne.
His Empire Narrow rules, and joys in blood:
The cause and ground of death that tyrant wood.
Howe oft alas, doth fancy fondly fain,
When slumber sweet in pensive parts doth reign,
And sléepe in eyes, all tired, with tears doth rest,
I apprehend dear Britons lively breast?
Ere while me thinks, his féeble shivering hands
He fenseth sure, with deadly blazing brands,
And fiercely on his brother Neros face,
With sturdy stinging strokes, he flies apace.
Ere while thilke wretch recoiled back again,
And to my thews for aid retires amain:
Him foaming foe pursues with hast to have:
And while my brother I desire to save,
And in my clasped arms to shield him frée,
His gore bloudyed fashion kéene, I sée
The boisterous ramping fiend to tug, and hale
Through out my shivering limbs, as ashes pale.
Forthwith a mighty trembling chattering quake,
From weary limbs, all souple sléepe doth shake,
And makes me, woeful wretch, for to recount,
My wailing sobbing sorrows that surmount.
Hereto, put to that gorgeous stately mouse,
All glistering bright, with spoils of Claudius house.
His parent dear in bubbling boat did douse.
That wicked son, this fisking dame to please.
Whom yet escaping dangers great of Seas,
He fiercer freak than waives that scantly rest,
With bloody blade his bowels did vnbrest.
What hope of health, can me, O wretch, abide,
That after them thilke way I should not ride?
My special foe, triumphant wise doth weight,
With naked nates to press, by lovers sleyght,
Our spousal, pure, and clean unspotted bed:
Against whom, she burns, with deadly food blood red.
And, for a mead of filthy strumpets sport,
She causes Make from spouse for to diuort.
O ancient Sire, steppe forth from Limbo lake,
Thy daughters heavy troublous cares to slake:
Or your twygated hellish porch unfold,
That down through gaping ground I may be told.
O piteous wretch, in vain, alas in vain
Thou call upon thy fathers senseless sprite:
In whom, God wot, there doth no care remain
Of mortal brood, that here doth take delight.
Shall he, think you, assuage your sorry chéere,
Or shape you forth some slight, t'appall your pain,
That could prefer, before his Briton déere,
T'imperiall throne, a strange begotten swain?
And with incestiall love benumbed quyte
His brother Germanicks daughter that could plight,
And join to him in solemn marriage rites,
With woeful, and unlucky lovers lights?
Here sprang the roil of hurly burly great,
Here beastly venomous slaughter began to sweat,
Here wily treasons trains appeared first,
Here rules desire, and brutish bloody thirst.
Sillanus first Prince Claudius son in law,
A bloody mangled offering fall we saw,
That in your graces Hymaeneal bed,
Y matched with you, he might not couch his head.
O monstrous slaughter, worthy endless blame:
In stead of gift unto that wanton dame,
A Carcass cold poor soul, and cureless corse,
Sillane was given against his will perforce.
And falsely then attached of traitors crime
As one conspiring death in Claudius time,
With loathsome streakes spewde out upon the wall,
He all bedasht your fathers princely hall.
Left stepped into servile Palace stroke,
To filthy vices lore, one easlye broke.
Of Devilish wicked wit this Princocks proud:
By stepdames while prince Claudius Son auoude.
Whom deadely damme did bloody match ylight:
And thée, against thy will, for fear did plight.
Through which success this Dame of courage fine,
Durst venture, mighty Jove to undermine.
Who can so many cursed kinds report
Of wicked hopes, and acts, in any sort,
Or such a women's glossed guiles can name,
That ramps at rule, by all degrées of shame?
Then holy sacred zeal put out of grace,
His stagring steppes, directed forth apace.
And stern Erinnis in with deadly steps,
To Claudius Court, all desert left yleps.
And with his dririe drakes of Stygian fort,
Hath quite distained the sacred princely port.
And raging riuen in twain both natures lore,
And right to wrongs misseshapen form hath tore.
That haughty minded dame first gave his make,
A deadely poisoned cup, his thirst to slake.
Straight ways again through vile unkindly touch,
His Narrow caused with him in hell to couch.
And thée, unhappy Britt, in all that broil,
Till that of breath, and life he did despoil,
Thilk gréedie bloody tyrant never stent:
Whose doleful death, for aye we may lament.
Ere while, unto the world the star that shone,
And was the staye of princely court alone,
Now lo, light ashes easly puffed aforne,
And grisly goast to grave with Torch yborne.
Whom blessed Babe, thy stepdame did lament:
Nor from his gushing tears, did scarce relent,
When as she gave eche trim appointed part,
And goodly portrait limbs with natures art,
Of flaming stack to be devoured quite,
And saw the scorching fervent fire in sight
Thy naked joints to rauyne up a pace
And like the flittering God thy comely face.
Dispatch he me least with this hand he fall.
That power you, nature granted not at all.
But wondrous dolor, great and wrathful ire,
And miseries will it grant without desire.
Nay rather cause your angry moody make,
With souple chéere his fury for to slake.
What, that he will by guilt once slain before,
Alive again my brother mée restore?
Nay, safe that you may live and issue bear:
Your fathers ancient court for to repair.
That court doth wait another brood they say.
And poor Brits death tugs me another way.
Yet let the cities love unto your grace,
Your troubled mind confirm but for a space.
Their minds so pressed to pleasure me, I know
Great comfort bring: but do not slake my woe.
Of mighty power the people have been aye.
But princes force doth bear the greater sway.
He will respect his lawful wedded wife.
His minion brave can not so lead his life.
Of no man she estéemde.
But dear to make.
She can not truly yet of wyfehoode croak.
Ere long shée shall a mother eke be made.
So far therein I dare most boldly wade.
His youthful heate at first in filthy love,
With lusty, crusty pangs doth boyle aboue:
Thylke courage quickly cooled in lust apace
As vapour soon extinct in flame, gives place.
But holy, loving, chaste vnspot••• spouse,
His love endures aye with s•••d vows.
That wanton first that there durst couch his head,
And tumbling stained quite your spousal bed,
And being but your maid hath ruled long,
His sovereign Lord, with beauties grace bestong,
That pranked Paramour pert shall crotch with pain,
When she your grace shall sée preferred again.
For Poppy subject is, and méeke of spright,
And now begins his goastly tombs to dight:
Whereby she closely granting doth bewray,
His secret hidden fear eche other day.
That swift, inconstant, double winged lad,
With clout, before his blinded eyes, yclad,
That fickle brained God, th'vnhappy boy,
Shall leave his in the midst of all his joy:
Although for beauty bright the bell shée bear,
And goodly glistering garments new shée wear,
And now do vaunt his self in gorgeous géere,
Shée shall not long enjoy this gladsome chéere.
Be not dismayed, Madame, for such like pain,
The quéene of Gods was forced to sustain,
When to eche pleasant shape the heavenly guide,
And sire of Gods yturnde, from skies did glide.
The swans white wings, to se how they could fadge
He did on him, and cuckolds bullish badge.
That God shone bright in golden rainy shower,
To Danes breast through top of fortred tower.
The twinkling stars, the twins of Laeda bright,
Whom Pollux some, and Castor call aright,
In large and ample space of starry scope,
With crystal glimmering faces shyne wide op.
An Similes son, whom Bacchus we do call,
In heavenly birthright doth himself ystall.
And, Hercules that puissant champion stout,
His sturdy browns his Hebe winds about.
Nor once regards how goddess Iuno fare:
Whose lowering stepdame now she is yframde,
That while on earth his prowes he did declare,
Against that marriage, aye, was sore inflamed.
Yet lo his wise, and closely couched gréefe,
Debonair face, obeisance to his léefe,
Caused him, at length his mind for to remove,
Through mortal féeres estranged from Iunos love.
And now that mighty heavenly goddess great,
No more adred of mortal strumpets feat,
Aloft alone in cloudy bower contents
The thundering Lord which now to his relents.
Nor now with earthly ladies beauty bright
Y fired, leaves his starry specked right.
Now Madame, sith on earth your power is pitch,
And have on earth quéene Iunos princely place,
And sister are, and wife to Neros grace,
Your wondrous restless dolours great appease.
Nay, sooner shall the roaring frothy seas,
And mounting, flashing flaws ymatch the sky,
And smoking, stiffling parching fire dry,
With danckish pools agrée, and watery fen.
And grisly Plutos filthy feltred den,
With starbright heaven shall sooner coupled bée,
And shining light, with glomie shades agrée,
And with the clear dry day, the dewy night,
Than unto servile lore of husband wight,
That brutishwise in blood takes his delight,
My heavy woeful mind can I address,
While brothers death my heart doth still possess.
O that of heavenly powers the prince, and sire,
That shogges &amp; shakes the earth, with thundering fire
And, with his wondrous fearful, cursed cracks,
And strange misseshapen monsters which he makes,
Our fearful musing minds doth sore amass,
Would coin some cureless burning wyldefyre blase,
To pelt, and pashe with thumpping fire bright,
That devilish pate, that cruel cursed wight.
We saw frō heaven, with beams forthshooting far,
Doubtless a dreadful hearie, blazing star:
That spouted forth a mortal fiery flake,
Whose force a princes blood can only slake:
Even where that hayting carman sloe Boot
With chilling cold all starck, of frozen pole,
Doth guide aright Charles whirling running rote,
In stead of night that never away doth role.
Lo, now the open ayre in every streate,
With doggish tyrants breath, is poisoned quite,
And dreadful stars soon sudden death doth threat.
To people, ruled by wicked Neros sprite.
So sterne a freak, or mankind tyrant stout,
Not Tellus with the Gods displeased brought out,
When mighty Jove neglected, she up horlde,
Huge, ugly, monstrous Typhon to the world.
A sorer plague, a cleaner scouring scourge,
With bloody paws that cities bounds doth purge,
Is Narrow dire, this cruel, cursed wight,
That doth him self against God, and man ydyght:
And thrusts from sacred shrines, their quiet port,
And goodly temples gay, the sancted sort:
That cities dwellers puts from countries fort:
That hath hereft his brother of his life,
And launched his mothers sides with gore knife:
Yet doth this present lightsome day enjoy,
And leads his life, that doth vs sore annoy.
O father of heaven, in vain why doest thou throw
Thy great unvanquished rattling thunder blow
Upon the whistling woods, and ample seas,
With force of princely power thy wrath t'appease?
On such an hurtful, and pernicious freak,
Thy due and just conceived ire to wreak.
Why stay thy mighty puissant braunes so long,
Ere thou fling down, thy rattling cracking throng?
O Lord that Narrow once might paye the price,
Of all his devilish déedes, and every vice,
Th'whole wide worlds tyrant stern, where he a stroke
Doth bear: which he over lades with burdnous yoke:
Of princely sire yborne, but doth defame,
With beastely manners vile his princely name:
Unworth he is, your spousal chamber place:
But yet your destnies force, you must embrace:
And well, abide your fortunes crooked race:
Nor move unkindly Neros gauly ire.
One day perchance, there will, as I desire,
Some God revenge your lamentable case:
And once, I trust, a gladsome day shall be,
When you shall joy a fresh in wonted place.
Ah, no, now, long this court alas, we see
With heavy wrath of Gods displeased ire
Hath overcharged been: which Venus dire
With Messalinas monstrous, romping lust,
She first hath brought down into the dust.
Who madly married to prince Claudius grace,
But little mindful then of that same case,
And not regarding much th'appointed payne,
With cursed cressets married once again.
To which unlucky 'incestuall bridal bed,
That drosell dire that furious slut Erin,
With hanging hair about his hellish head,
And girt with snakes with deadly step went in.
And flaming broandes from spousal chamber caught,
In both their bloods ybathde, hath quentched clean:
And hath incensed prince Claudius burning thought,
In bloody throttling stroke to pass all mean.
My mother first of wretches all the most,
With strype of deadly sword gave up his gost.
And now extinguished quite left me forlorn,
With dolours pining pangs and mourning worn.
And after his in hellish team doth hail,
Unto the senseless souls of Plutos jail
His make, and Britannic his son that way:
And first this ruinous court did she betray.
Let be, Madame, with tears your face to dight:
No so renew your bitter wailing just:
Cease troubling now, your parents piteous spright,
That payed hath the price of raging lust.
GOd grant the talk we heard of late,
To rashly trusted every where,
And blown abroad through eche estate,
No badge of truth, that it may bear.
And that no fresh espoused dame,
Our princes thews doe enter in,
But that Octauia kéepe the same.
And that the séede of Claudius kin,
May once bring forth some pledge of peace:
That to the world rest may redowne,
And wrangling strife may easly cease,
And Rome retain his great renown.
The péerlesse princess Iuno hight,
His brothers wedlock yoke retains:
Why is Augustus sister bright,
Where like betrothed league remains,
From stately pomp of court reject?
What doth deuoutnesse his avail?
To saincted sire, who hath respect?
What doth his Virgins life prevail?
And, Claudius now in ground ylayed,
Even we to much unmindful bée:
Whose worthy stem we have betrayed
Through fear, that made vs to agrée.
In breast our elders did embrace,
The perfect Romaine puissance,
The true unstained worthy race,
And blood of Mars they did advance.
The proud, and lofty stomached train
Of lusty haughty minded kings,
They could not suffer to remain
Within this noble Cities wings.
And justly they revenged thy death,
O virgin chaste, Virginia pure,
Deprived by sire of vital breath,
That bondage thou might not endure.
And that his shameless brutish lust,
So good a méede might not enjoy:
Although by filthy force unjust
Thy chastity he would annoy.
Thée likewise whom thine own right hand,
With sword did pearce Lucretia true,
Who tyrants rape could not withstand,
Did bloody broils and wars ensue.
And with thy proud disdainful make
Lord Tarquin imp of cursed séede,
Correction due doth Tullia take
For his unkindly shameless déede.
Who on his fathers mangled corse,
To mischief bent, and wicked bane,
The carman she to drive did force,
His cruel bruising wombling wane.
And quyte against all natures law,
Even from his own dismembered sire,
The sacred rytes shée did withdraw,
Denaying wonted burial fire.
This grief or woeful age doth féele,
Through monstrous act against all kind,
When as in deadly crafty kéele,
To Tyrrhen seas, and wrestling wind,
The proud presuming prince did put,
His mother trapt in subtle sort.
The mariners appointed cut,
The swelling seas from pleasant port.
The clash resounds with stroke of ores,
The ship, out launched, a pace doth spin,
In surging froth aloof from shores,
And ample course of seas doth win.
Which gliding forth with leusned planks,
In pressed streams with peised weight,
The rifts do open closed cranks,
That hidden were, with secret slight:
And gulped up the leaking wane:
The woeful, roaring noise, and cry,
With women's shrieks themselves to save,
Doe reach, and beat the starry sky.
Then grisly present death doth dance
Before their eyes with pining chéekes:
Whose deadly stroke and heavy chance
For to auyde, then eche man séekes:
On ryuened ribs some naked lye,
And cut the beating waives in twain:
And some their skilful swimming try,
To get unto the shore again.
The greatest part that sailed there,
By destnies dire to men prefixed,
In whirling swallows drowned were,
The brinks of seas and ground betwixt.
Quéene Agryppine his garments rends,
She tears his ruffled locks of hear,
Abundant blubbering tears she spends,
Through déepe distress of fainting fear.
Who, when no hope of health she spies,
Inflamed with wrath, which woes appeasde,
O son, for so great gifts, she cries,
Hast thou with such reward me pleased?
This kéele I have deserved sure,
That bare and brought thée first to light:
Who empire witless did procure,
And Cesars title for thy right.
Show forth thy fearful spritish face,
O Claudius now from Limbo lake,
And of thy wife in wretched case,
Revenge and due correction take.
Thy death I causeless did conspire,
Which now I rue with woeful hart:
I dressed eke a funeral fire,
Into thy son by deadly smart.
Lo, now as I deserved have,
Untomde go to thy guiltless goast,
Enclosed in seas in stead of grave,
And wrestling waives of Romaine coast.
The flashing flaws do flap his face,
And on his speaking mouth do beat,
Anon shée sinks a certain space,
Depressed down with surges great:
Anon shée fléetes on weltering brim,
And pattes them off with tender hands:
Through fainting fear then taught to swim,
Approaching death, and fates withstands.
At length on troubled seas displayed,
Shée giving over working vain,
And tired with streams is weary laid,
Not able toiling strength to strain.
In close, and secret silent breasts
Of mates with hirto sea that yode,
In whom no fear of death there rests,
True faith unto their quéene abode.
Their ladies weather heaten limbs
To help some fréely venture dare,
Some in the coombrous waters swims,
And desperate danger do not spare.
With cheerful voice they comfort his,
Though drawlyng draggling limbs she drew,
To lift his up with help they stir,
And numbed corps to strength renew.
What boots it thée the death to shone
Of roaring raging ravening waives,
From deadly sword of wicked son,
Alas poor wretch thée nothing saves?
Whose huge and heinous cursed rage,
Against all course of natures lore,
Our after slow beléeuing age,
Will scarce beléeue it done before.
The devilish man repynde with grief
When he his mother saved saw,
From swallowing seas have safe reléefe
And that she vital breath did draw,
He grudgde with grief: and in his heate,
He huger mischief heaps to this:
He doth not once delay his feat,
But headlong rashly carried is
Upon her death. A soldier sent,
Dispatchesh that he had in charge,
His ladies breast his blade doth rent:
Shée yéelding up his soul at large,
From wretched corps for to entomb
His slaughter man, she then besought,
That bloody blade within her womb,
That first this woe to his had brought,
This, this accursed breast ({quod} shée)
Which this unkindly monster bare,
From pinching pain may not be frée:
Dig, slash the same, no mischief spare.
When this with foultring tong was said,
At last his sad and trembling goast,
With latter sobbing sighs, unstaid,
Through goryd wounds leaves vital coast.
IN me with like cōsent, why did thou smile,
With glossed looks deluding me a while,
O fortune much of might &amp; princely power?
To lift aloft to noble royal bower?
To th'ende that I to honours court extolled
From stately seat might have the greater fall,
And round about in every place behold,
Such dreadful, threating dangers to vs all?
I safer lay aloof from envies knocks,
Removed among the craggy corsick rocks:
Where as my mind there frée at propre swaye,
With leisure did repeat my studies aye.
A gladsome joy alone it was to view,
And earnestly to mark the heuens so blew:
And sacred Phoebus double whéeled wayne:
And eke the worlds swift whirling motion mayne.
The Sun so even his second course to kéepe:
And Phebes gliding globe so swiftly swéepe:
Whom wondrous starting stars encompass round.
And to behold, that shines in every stoned,
The glistering beauty bright of welkin wide:
Than which in all the world, nothing beside,
Of all this huge and endless work, the guide,
More wondrous, nature, framed that I espied.
For all the bumping bigness it doth bear,
Yet waxing old is like again to wear,
And to be changed to an vnwyldie lump.
Now pressed at hand this worlds last day doth jump,
With boisterous fall, and tumbling rush of sky,
To squeeze, and make this cursed kind aby.
That springing once again, it may yéelde out,
An other strange renewed virtuous route.
As once before, it did, new sprung again,
What time Saturnus held his golden reign.
That blameless, chaste, unspotted virgin cléere,
A goddess much of might, clept Justice here,
With sacred sooth sent down from heavenly space,
At ease on earth did rule the mortal race.
That people plain knew not of warlike feats,
Nor trembling trumpets tune, that rends, &amp; beats,
The soldiers ears: nor chasshing armour bright,
That warring wights defend in field, and fight.
Nor wonted was with walls to raumpire round,
Their open Cities set in any stoned.
To eche man passage free lay opened than:
Nothing there private was to any man.
And then the ground it self, and fertile soil,
His fruitful bosom baarde all void of toil,
Into such bounden barus, a Matron good,
And peaceable unto so just a brood.
But then, an other second race arose,
Perceived not to be so méeke as those.
A third more wise, and witty sort up starts,
Of nature forged fit t'inuent new arts:
As yet unspotted quite with filthy vice.
Soon after tho, they raundge with new device,
That boldly venture dare in scudding race,
Vnweldie beasts for to pursue apace.
And mighty weighing, struggling fishes great,
With watery coats yclad, with fishers feat,
With net in window wise draw forth: and stréeke
With craft of quill, the nibbling fishes chéeke.
And silly byrdee begylde with pining train:
And light foot déere, for life that fling amain
In tangling gins entrapped, that safely hold.
And sturdy scowling visagde bulls controlled,
On flesshie fillet necks, make wear the yoke:
And earth ere that vngrubbed up that broke:
Which thē turned up, with plowmans shining share,
In sacred bosom déepe, his fruits kept their.
But now this age much worse than all the rest,
Hath leapt into his mothers broken breast:
And rusty lumpish iron, and massy gold,
Hath dug out, that was quite hid with mould.
And fighting fists have armed without delay:
And drawing forth their bonds for rule to staye,
Have certain several ioyly kingdoms made,
And cities new have raside now ruled with blade,
And fenseth, either with their propre force
Strange stounds, or them assaults, the which is worse.
The starry specked virgin flower of skies,
Which Justice hight, that guilty folk dis••ies,
Now lightly estée〈…〉e of mortal people here,
Each erthly stoned is fled, and comes not néere
The savage manuerd rout, and beastly rude,
With dabbed wrists in gore blood embrued.
The great desire of grisly war is sprung:
And raping thirst of gold, it is not young.
Throughout the world, a mighty monstrous vice,
Foul, filthy, monstrous just hath got the price,
A pleasant tickling plague: whom longer space,
And error déepe have fostered up a pace.
The heaps of vice, •…akte up in years long past,
Abounding flow in these out days at last.
And this same troublous time, and combrous age,
Oppresses all m•• sore, both young and sage.
Wherein those wicked ways that be, do reign,
And cruel, ramping woodnesse boils again.
Lust strong in filthy touch, doth bear a swaye:
And princes, riot, now doth catch away
With gréedie paws, to bring it to decay,
Th'whole worlds uncredible wealth, without delay,
But lo, which staggring steps where Narrow flings,
And visage grim, I fear what news he brings.
DIspatch with spéede, that we cōmaūded have:
Go, send forthwith some one, or other slave,
That Plautius cropped scalp, &amp; Sillas eke,
May bring before our face: go some man seek.
I nill protract your noble graces hest:
But to their camps to go am ready pressed.
Against lynage, nought should rashly pointed be.
A light thing it is for to be just, I sée
For him, whose hart is void of shrinking fear.
A sovereign salve for fear, is for to bear,
Your self debonair to your subjects all.
Our foes to slay, a chefetaines virtue call.
A worthier virtue it is, in countries sire,
His people to defend with sword, and fire.
It well beséems such aged wights, to teach,
Unbridled springolls young, and not to preach,
Both to a man, and prince of ryper years.
Nay rather frolic youthful blood appears,
To have more néede of counsel wise, and grave.
(This age sufficient reason ought to have.)
That heavenly powers your doings may allow.
A madnesse't were to Gods for me to bow,
When I my self can make such Gods to be:
As Claudius now ycounted is we se.
So much the more, because so much you may.
Our power permits vs all without deny.
Give slender trust to fortunes flattering face:
She topste turuie turns his whéele a pace.
A patch he is that knows not what he may.
A princes praise I counted have always,
To do that same which with his honour stood,
Not that which frantic fancy counts good.
If that I were a meacock, or a slouch,
Eche stubborn, clubbish daw would make mée couch.
And whom they hate with force they ouerquell.
Then, dynt of sword the prince defended well.
But faith more sure defence doth seem to me.
Full méete it is that Caesar dreaded be.
More méete of subjects for to be beloved.
From subjects minds fear must not be removed.
What so by force of arms you do wring out,
A grievous work it is to bring about.
Well hardly then our will let them obey.
Will nothing then but that which well you may.
We will decrée what we shall best suppose.
What peoples voice doth jointly bind or lose,
Let that confirmed stand. No. Swords bloody dynt
Shall cause them else at me to take their hynt.
God shéeld, and far that fact from you remove.
What then, why Seneck do you that approve,
That we contemnde, despised, and set at nought,
With finger put in hole (full wisely wrought)
Our bodies blood to seek should them abide,
That they might vs sometime destroy vnspide?
Their native country bounds to banished bée,
Nor Plautius breast nor Syllas eke we sée
Hath broke, or tamed: whose cankered churlish ire,
Shapes bloody freakes to quench our bodies fire.
And chiefly when these traitorous absent clowns,
Such wondrous favour find in cities bones,
Which those same exiles lingering hope doth féede:
Suspected foes with sword we will out wéede.
And so Octauia shall that ioyly dame,
Continue after them their bloody game.
And wend that way her noun white brother went,
Such hye mistrusted things must néedes be bent.
It is, O prince, a worthy famous thing,
Amyds redoubted Lords alone to ring:
And wisely work your countries praise to save:
And well your self to captive folk behave:
From cruel brutish slaughter to abstain:
And void of mood to wreak your angry pain:
And, to the world a quiet calm to give,
That all your age in peace their lives may live.
This is a Princes praise without all crime:
This is the path to heaven whereby we climb.
So is Augustus prince and father called
Of country first, in starbright throne ystald.
Whom as a God in minsters we adorn,
Yet troublous fortune tossed him beforne,
A great while long on lands, and ruffling seas,
Until his fathers foes he could appease,
And through wars divers course could qual thē quite.
To you did fortune yield his power, and might,
And raynes of rule without all blood, and fight.
And to your beck both land, and seas hath bent.
Grim deadly envy daunted doth relent.
The Senate Lords gave place with frée consent:
The battaylous route of knights with willing hearts
(That same decree from sager syres departes)
Unto the lay men's choice doe well agrée.
Your grace the spring of peace they count to be.
And chosen Judge, and guide of mortal stock.
Your grace, your countries sacred sire, doth rock,
And rule with princely gorgeous title bright,
The cyrcled world in rundell wisely ydight.
Which mighty mounting name to kéepe so great,
This noble city Rome, doth you entreat:
And doth commend unto your royal grace,
His lively limbs in charge for your lives space.
The gift of Gods it is, as we discus,
That Rome with Senate sort doth honour vs.
And that the fear of our displeasure great,
From cankered envious stomaks makes sweat
Both humble talk, and supplications méeke.
And were not fear all these would be to seek.
Unwieldy, combrous cities members ill,
That prince, and country both doe seek to spill,
To leave alive (which swell, and puffed bée,
Because of lynage great, and hye degree)
What madness mere is it when as we may,
Even with a word, such freakes dispatch away?
Sir Brutus stern, his browns and arms did dight.
His sovereign liege to slain by force and might,
That erst had helped him, and given him health,
And had endued him with princely wealth.
In brunt of raging war, undaunted out,
That vanquished many people strong, and stout,
Prince Caesar, mateht, by great degrées of power.
To Jove, in stately chair of starry bower,
By devilish citizens wicked while, was slain.
What store of bloody, stiffling streams on mould
Did tattred Rome, of his own limbs, behold?
He by his noble virtues worthy praise,
Whom peoples common brute to heaven doth raise,
August, among the Gods ysaincted well,
How many noble breasts did he compel,
How many springolds young, and hoary heads,
Eche where dispersed, to lig in moulded beds?
How many men did he bereave of breath,
Tofore proscript, that were condemned to death?
When for the grisly fear of deadly dart,
From propre home they were constrained to part,
And fly Octauius force, and Lepidus might,
And not abide sterne Mark Antonius sight,
Which then the ample world at once did guide,
That into kingdoms thrée they did divide.
To dumpish sadded syres, with heavy chéere,
Their childerns grisly cropped pates appéere,
Hong out beforne the Senates judgment seat,
For eche man to behold in open street:
No durst they once lament their piteous case,
Nor inward séeme to morn to Claudius face.
The market stead, with blood from bodies spued,
And loathsome mattrie streams, is all embrued:
And, quite throughout, their faces foul arrayed
The pitcous gubs of blood drop down, unstaid.
Nor here did this same slaughterous bloodshed stay:
Phyllips, Pharsalia ghastly fields eche day
The cromming ravening fowls, and cruel beasts,
Long fed, with gobbets big of manly breasts.
Beside all this, the coast he scoured quyte
Of Sicill sea, and ships to war yoyght
With force of arms did win: and havoc made
Of propre subjects, slain with his own blade.
The rundle round of lands with mighty maine
Of noble chieftains stroke, reboyles again.
Antonius overcome in naval fight,
To Egipt posts in ships prepared to flight:
Not looking long to live, nor hoping life.
Incestuous Egipt (through Antonius wife)
That worthy Romaine princes blood, did suck:
And covered lye their goasts with dirty muck.
Long wicked, waged civil war, there stayed,
In Mark Antonius grave, with him ylayed.
Augustus at the last, of conquest great
His dulled swords, that wounded souls did beat
In peaceable sheaths reposed, hath laid at rest:
And fear doth rule, and guide his kingdom best.
By ready force of arms at all assays,
And Captains saith he shéeldes himself always:
Whom now his sons most worthy virtues praise,
To heaven a consecrated God doth raise,
And causes all, in Churches for to place
The sacred Picture of prince Claudius grace.
And vs, the starry reign of Gods shall bide
If first, with dreadful sword about vs wide,
We wipe away, what so our person stain:
And found our court with worthy stem again.
Your noble spouse, sprung forth of saincted péere,
Of Claudius stock, the starbright Diamond clear,
That goddess Iuno wise his brothers bed
Partaking, pressed down with buttocks red,
Your graces princely court shall garnish gay,
With wondrous heavenly fair descended stay.
Incestuous married dames, from stock, and stem,
Detract all hope, that we should have of them.
Nor vs, could she once love, that we could sée,
Nor with our person once at all agrée.
In tender budding years, when love suppressed
With blushing, hydes the flames of burning breast,
Scant plain appears the love they bear in déede.
Thus we our self with hope in vain did féede:
Although undoubted signs, as body wried,
And frowning looks, which we have oft espied,
His spiteful, hating stomach did bewray
Which she doth bear, whom duty binds to obey.
Which yet at last, big, boiling, gréeuous pain
With death determinde hath t'auenge again.
We have found out, for birth, and beauties grace
A worthy make, for such an Empress place:
To whom, that lovely goddess, Venus bright,
And mighty Jove his spouse that Iuno hight,
And goddess fierce in boisterous warlike arts,
Gives place for bodies séemely portrait parts.
Faith, meekness, manners mild, &amp; hashfull shame
Of spouse, those ought an husband to reclaim.
The pearls of judging mind, alone remain,
Not subject once to any rulers reign.
The passing pride of beauties numming grace
Eche day appals, and bleamisheth a pace.
What praises woman wights have in thē closed?
All those, in his alone hath God reposed.
And such a péerelesse péere, the guides of life,
The destnies would have borne to be our wife.
O noble prince such blind, unlawful love,
(Do rashly credit nought) from you remove.
Whom Jove can not repell that rules the clouds,
And piercing raging floods, therein him shrouds,
And ranges through the reign of Plutos pit,
And pulls down in welkin hie that sit
The mighty powers of heaven, the God of love?
And can I then his force from me remove?
Swift winged love, men's fanste fond, in vain
A mercy wanting God to be, doth fame:
And arms his hands with wounding weapons kéene
And bows with burning bronds, for lovers gréene:
Of Venus to be sprung, they all accord,
And blindly forgde, of thunders limping Lord.
Bland love the minds great torment sore, appears,
And buddeth first, in frolic youthful years.
Who, while we drink of fortunes pleasant cup,
With laysie pampring riot, is nestled up:
Whom if to foster up, you leave at length
It fleting, falls away with broken strength.
This is, in all our life, as I suppose
The greatest cause, how pleasure, first arose.
Which sith mankind by brooding, bids eyed,
Through gladsome love, that fierce wilde beasts doth sway
It never can, from manly breast depart.
This self same God, I wish with all my heart
The wedlock lights to bear before our grace,
And fasten Poppy, sure, in our bed place.
The peoples grief might never yield to it:
Nor virtue can, the same at all, permit.
Shall I alone to do, forbidden bée,
That every patch may do? that gréeueth mée.
No trifling toys, the people looks to have
Of him, that ought to rule with wisdom grave.
It pleases vs, with daunted power, to try,
If peoples rash conceived rage, will fly.
Seek rather for to please, and calm their mood.
Ill ruled is that reign where people wood,
Their subject prince doth weld, as they think good.
When nought that they require they can obtain,
They justly then aggrieved are again.
That gentle prayers can not win with ease,
By force to wring it out, it doth vs please.
An hard thing it is the people not to have
That of their Prince, which they do justly crave.
And horrible it is a Prince to be constrained.
Let not your subjects then so sore be raind.
Why then the common brute abroad will be.
How that the people have subdued me.
That no man trusts, that is of credit light.
Be it so, yet many it marks with deadly spite.
With country péeres to meddle, it is afraid.
To quip and frump, it is nothing less dismayed.
Your grace may easly couch that budding brute.
Let saincted syres deserts with pliant suit,
Your graces mind, remove: let spouses age,
And courteous bashful shame disrump your rage.
Leave off, I say, that we entend, to grutch.
For now your talk, our patience moves much:
I pray you let it lawful be to do,
That Seneck gives not advise unto.
And we, our peoples wishes do defer,
While Poppy féele in wombling womb to ster,
The pledge of faithful love to me, and her.
Why do we not appoint the morrow next,
When as our marriage pomp may be context?
THrough paunch of riuened earth, from Plutos rain
With goastly steps, I am returned again.
In writhled wrists that blood do most desire,
Forguiding wedlock vile, with Stygian fire.
Let Poppy 〈◊〉 these 〈◊〉 coupled sure,
Unto my soune be ioynde in marriage pure:
Whom mothers grief, and hand revenging wrecks,
Shall send with heave and hoe, to funeral stacks.
I always doe remember well beneath,
Where piteous, ghostly, crauling souls doe breath,
The unkindly, slaughterous déede, which to our spright
Yet unrevenged, is gréeuous, and of right.
And, for the good I did, a cruel pryse,
That deadly framed ship in crafty wise:
And due reward, that he gave me again,
For helping him to rule of Empires reign:
And eke that night, when as I did bewail,
Both less of ship, wherein we then did sail,
And mates unhappy beath: and while I thought,
For this accuessed d•ede, to have besought
The Gods, to trickling tears he gave scant time,
But twice increased hath his devilish crime.
Quyte slain with sword, thrust through my bodies bosids
And 〈◊〉 laid through goa••e mat〈…〉ing wounds,
Delivered safe, from seas 〈…〉ing sup,
In antique court, my goast I yielded up.
Nor yet his cankered, and vnfatiate hate,
For all this blood, doth Narrow once abate.
That tyrant dire doth rage at mothers name,
And séeketh ways, my déedes for to defame.
Who threating death to them that doe withstand,
My shapes he dingeth down, in every land:
My princely tyties large he scrapeth out
In every place, the whole wide world about,
Which my 〈◊〉 parents love did give,
To much unto my 〈◊〉, while I did live,
••th a boy to g•yde, which now Irue.
My poisoned Make, my ghost doth oft pursue:
And in my face, with burning bronds, doth fly.
He stays a space with earnest talk hard by,
And threatened sore, and doth impute his death
And tomb he should have had, to me beneath.
And now desires to have some factious wight,
That dare despoil my son of breathing spright.
Let be, you shall have one to work this crime,
I do require no long delayed time.
Revenging spirit Erin, a death doth coin,
Of life, that wicked tyrant, to purloin.
Sore smarting leaden strypes, and shameful flight,
And pining pangs, with thirst and hunger dyght:
That Tantalus spungelyke thurstie mouth befurd,
And Sisyphus toil shall pass, and Tityus hurd,
And Ixions painful, wombling whéele about,
That tears all his bodies parts throughout.
Although that tyrant proud and scornful wight,
His court with marble stone do strongly dyght,
And princelike garnish it with glistering gold:
Though troupes of soldiers shielded sure, uphold
Their chieftains princely porch: &amp; though yet still
The world drawn dry with tasks even to his will,
Great heaps of riches yéelde them selves to save,
Although his bloody help, the Parthians crave,
And kingdoms bring, and goods all that they have,
The time, and day shall come, when as he shall
Forlorn, and quite undone, and wanting all,
Unto his cursed déedes, his life, and more,
Unto his foes, his board throat restore.
Alas, unto what end is all my pain,
Or in what case, do now my vows remain?
Whereto doth now thy rage, and destnies spyte
Draw thée, O son, with brain benumbed quyte?
That to such monstrous heaps of ylls thy dame
(Whō thou, with cursed mischief overcame)
His wrath should yéeld? O that, ere to the light
A sucking babe I brought thée forth in sight,
And fed thée fine with pap, as princely borne,
The fierce, wild, savage beasts had rent and torn
My womb, and bloody entrails all beforne.
Without all crime, and wanting reasons pride,
Mine own déere dandling child you should have died.
And fastened sure to me shuldst aye behold,
The quiet place, where ghostly souls be told:
And sée thy grand syres great of worthy same,
And sire Domitius eke of princely name,
Whom now, both shame, and wailing doth abide,
That while they dure, from them shall never slyde.
For which, both thée, O cursed barn, they may,
And mée, that thée have borne give thanks for aye.
But why cease I, with Hell to hide my face,
Wife, stepdame, mother dire, in my life space?
DO not, alas, thus sore lament,
But rather yet your mourning stay,
Sith that the city whole is bent
To celebrate this joyful day:
Least your great love, and favour both,
Which I do count to be most sure,
The more cause Narrow me to loath,
And eke his bitter wrath procure:
And I fall out to be the ground
To you of many mischiefs vile,
This same is not the first déepe wound,
That I have felt now this good while:
Far worse than this have I abode:
But of these troublous cares, this day
Shall make an end, I trust in God,
Although with death he doe me pay.
No man to sée shall mée constrain
His bended brows knit furrows,
Nor step within the chamber reign
Of maid dressed up in bridal guise.
Augustus sister I will bée,
And not his wife, as wont I was:
But only pains remove from mée,
And fear of death, I will not pass.
Yet can thou, piteous wretch, once trust,
Thy cruel husbands father law,
Or these few things to have so just
While mischiefs yet in mind are raw?
Now long reserved, until this day,
And these same marriage rytes be past,
Thou shalt poor wretch, without delay,
A bloody offering dye at last.
Why thus with tears disfigured sore
Thy wonted home doest thou behold?
Make haste, to shun this deadly shore,
And leave this straughtrous Princes fold.
Lo se that day suspected long,
And whispered fame in all men's ears,
With glistering pomp of bridal throng,
To vs poor wretches, now appears.
And Claudius brood, Octauias grace,
From Neros wedlock place expelled,
Departed is, whose spousal space,
Hath Poppy conqueror long time held.
The while, our piety couched lies
Kept down with heavy, combrous fear,
And slow revenging grief likewise:
Where doth the peoples power appear,
That brake the force of princes great,
That conquerous city laws hath framed,
That worthy men to honours seat
Preferred, that war and peace proclaimed,
That savage people strange did tame
That kings and princes caught in fight,
Shut surely up in prison frame,
To kéepe them close from all men's sight?
Lo, which we can not once abide,
To see, where Poppies image trim,
Conjoined unto Neros side
All glistering bright, shines very brim.
Let force of arms pull down that frame
And match with ground that ladies face
Too likely carved to his name,
And snatch his down from bedding place,
And let it forthwith fly with brands
With Darts and Javelins fiercely flong,
From pithy browns and sturdy hands,
Unto the princes courtly throng.
FRom out of spousal bower dismayed with fear,
Whither go you? what secrets daughter dear
Unknown, makes you to look so drouselye?
Why spungelike looks your face with tears frō eye
That fell? of truth, the time desired long,
And wished for by prayers, and vows among
Hath shined bright. Caesars wedlock are you:
Your golden grace, whereof he toke the view.
Him prisoner caught, and did him surely bind,
So much the more, how much Seneck his mind
Did seek to change, and wild from love to wéeld.
And Venus chief in love hath made him yéeld.
O in beauty passing all, what beds than down
More soft, have borne thy wight: when you with crown
Did sit in midst of court, the Senate all
At thy great beauty aghast, thou did appal:
Whilst thou the Gods with perfume sensedst fine,
And sacred altars drenched with thankful wine,
Thy head attired with veyle of yellow hew.
By Cesars side thou went as princess new:
When he aloft extolled aboue the reast,
With haughty courage merrily went to feast.
Like as King Peleus went some times to take
Quéene Tithes, whom salt seas some bred, his make
Whose briding chambers, banquetwise ydrest,
The Gods vouchsaaft to hallow with their hest,
Both they that rule in skies, and eke in seas.
But tell, O Lady, tell, if it you please,
What sudden chance doth shade your beauties light?
What means your colour change from red to white?
What moves those trickling tears, how stands your plight?
With dreams, and grisly sights, this last night nurse,
My mind was troubled sore, but frayd much worse.
For when sir Phoebe his weary course had rid,
While quiet resting night eche thing shadid,
My senses weary fell in slumber déepe,
While Narrow me within his arms did cléepe.
Resolving limbs, at length began sléepe discharge,
And long I rest not under quiets targe.
For lo, I saw a rout, that brought me fear,
Come to my chamber with dishevelled hear:
The Matrons sage of Latin land did morn,
And sounded shrycking sighs as though forlorn
They were, the dolefulst wights that live on ground.
And oft among the warlike trumpets sound,
I saw my husbands mother terribly stand,
With threatening look berayed with blood, in hand,
A light fire brand shée bare which oft shée shook,
And made me go with his, through fearful look.
When down we came through op'ned earth, she led
The way, I after went with bowing head,
And musing much thereat, mark what I say,
My bed, me thought I saw, wherein I lay,
When first espousde I was to Rufe Cryspine:
And he me thought, with first son of his line,
With many following them, against me fast
Did come, and me to cléepe did swift his hast,
And as he wouted was, he kiss me oft.
Then rushed into my house, with pace not soft
Amassed Narrow sore, in Crispines breast
That hid his fashion kene: fear shook of rest
From me: I trembling stood with quivering fear,
And breast dismayed to speak made me forbear.
Till now O ••rs I met with thée, whose trust,
And faith into these words have made me burst.
Alas what threatened me eche griesty sprite?
What means of husbands blood that doleful sight?
The hidden sacred vain that moves swift,
Which fantasy we call by secrete drift,
When we do take our rest, doth show again,
The things both good and bad that broil in brain.
You marvel that you saw your make, and bower,
His goastly funeral stacks, at that same hour,
Round clasped close in arms of husband new:
Hereto, the beaten breasts with hands moved you,
And maidens hear, on marriage day displayed:
Octauias friends with heavy harts, betrayed,
Amids his brothers booth, and fathers hall
Their heavy chéere, for his unlucky fall.
That dreadful blazing flame of fire foreborne
In Agryppinas hands, your grace beforne,
Which you did follow straight, declares renown
To you, though envy strive to keep it down:
The seat you saw beneath, doth promise you
Your state to stand full sure, not changing new:
That Narrow prince in Crispins throat did hyde
His swerd, it tells that he in peace shall bide,
Unknown to bloody ruthful war for aye.
Therefore, madame, pluck up your hart, I pray:
Receive both mirth, and glée, cast fear aside,
With joy, and ease you may in bower abide.
To temples hie, where mighty Gods do dwell,
I will repair, and offerings to them fell
In humble wise, their heavy wrath t'appease,
And me of mighty sight, and dreams to ease,
My second with shall be, that this fear all,
Upon my foes as sudden chance may fall.
O nurse, pray thou for me, some vows do make
To the Gods, that ghostly fear his flight may take.
IF stelth disclosed by blabbing fame,
And lusty, pleasant, thankful love,
Of Jove be true: who foe••no did frame
Of Swan, to come from skies aboue,
And did enjoy the swéet consent,
Of Lady Leads loves delight:
Who like a Bull his labour spent,
Through flowing fluds to carry quite.
Europe sliely stolen away:
He will no doubt, leave reign of sky
And Poppies love disguised, assay.
If he his sovereign beauty spy.
Which he might well prefer before
Fair Leads sugared swéete delight:
And Danaë whom he won of yore
Amazed with golden shower so bright:
Let Sport now for Helens sake
Of beauty, bragging fame vpraise:
Admit the Trojan herdsman make
Of gained spoil triumphant praise:
Fair Helen here is stained quite:
Whose beauty bred such boiling ire,
That earth was matched even in sight
With Trojan towers consumed with fire.
But who is this that runs with fear oppressed?
Or else what news brings he in panting breast?
WHat sturdy champion stout doth joy with glee
Our chieftains royal bower safe to sée,
Then to his court, I counsel him to wend,
Against which the populus rout their force doth bend.
The rulers run amazed to fetch the guard,
And armed troupes of men, their town to ward.
Nor woodnesse rashly caught through fear, doth cease,
But more and more, their power doth increase.
What sudden rage doth beat their broiling brain?
The garrisons great with fury astonde again,
And stirred up for Quéene Octauias sake
With monstrous mischief vile, their rage to slake,
They rumbling rush into the Palace far.
What dare they do, their counsailers who are?
Advance their Empress old, subvert the new:
And grant his, brothers beds, as is his due.
Which Poppy now, with hole consent doth hold?
Yea that unbridled rage in breast vprold,
Sets them agog, and makes them wondrous wood.
What ever image graven in marble stood,
If Poppies badge it bare, or if in sight,
It tended for to show his beauty bright,
Though it on heavenly altares brave did stand,
They break, or pull it down, with sword or hand.
Some parts with ropes sure tide, they trail thē forth,
Which spurnd with dirty f•ete, as though nought worth
With filthy stinking mire, they it all beray.
And with their déedes their talk doth jump agrée,
Which mine amassed mind, thinks true to bee.
For fiery flames they threat for to prepare,
Wherewith to waste, the princes Palace fair,
Unless, unto their furious mood he give
His second wife, and with Octauia live,
But he by me shall know in what hard stay
The City stands: the rulers Isle obey.
Alack, what made you cruel wars, in vain
To move, sith prisoner love you can not gain?
You can not him overcome, your fiery flame
He recks not: his sirs ouercomes the same.
He darkened hath those thundering things that shake
Heaven, Earth, Hell, Sea, al things yt makes to quake.
Yea mighty Jove, in heaven that wears chief crown
His flames from welkin hie hath brought down.
And you, not victors now, but vanquished,
Shall ransom pay, the price of hearts blood red.
Love, patient can not be, but hot in rage,
No easy thing it is, his wrath t'asswage.
Achilles worthy wight, that was so stout,
To twang the Harp he made in Ladies rout,
Prince Agamemnon sterne that boy benumd,
And rabble rude of Gréekes with love bronds bumd.
King Priams reign he topsy turuis tossed,
And goodly Cities great he chiefly lost.
And now my mind sore frighted stands aghast,
What Cupids furious force brings vs at last,
AH, ah, our captains sloe dispatching coil,
And our long suffering ire in such a broil,
That streams of blood yet do not quench their rage
Which they against our propre person wage.
And that all Rome, with corses strewd about,
Those cruel villains blood, doth not sweat out.
But déedes already done, with death to pay
A small thing it is, a greater slaughtrous day
The peoples cursed crime, and eke that dame,
Whom I did aye suspect, deserves the same.
To whom, to yield those peasants would me make:
At last she shall, with life our sorrow slake,
And with his bodies blood shall quench our ire.
Then, shall their houses fall by force of fire:
What burning both, and buildings fair decay,
What beggarly want, and wailing hunger may,
Those villains shall be sure, to have eche day.
Ah Provender pricks that vile rebellious race,
No can they once our favour well embrace,
Nor be content, with peace in quiet state,
But broiling ramp about with troubled gate.
Hereon with boldness straight hereon they fly,
With harebraind rashness hedling by and by.
Well, they must tamed be with heavy stroke,
And down be kept with peise of weighty yoke:
That they, with like attempt, doe not arise,
Nor once cast up their deadly peasants eyes,
Against our loving spouses golden looks:
First punish them sure, then fear shall be their books,
To teach them, at their Princes beck to obey.
But sée at hand, whom faith, and virtue rare,
Lieutenant chief of camps, appointed their.
THe vulgar peoples rash unruly rage,
The slaughter of a few did soon assuage,
Which long wtstode our valiant force in vain,
To tel your grace this news, I come again.
And is this then enough, doest thou so well,
O soldier mark what doth thy captain tell?
Hast thou with held thy hand from bloody ire?
Is this the due revenge that we require?
The captain guides of treason paid their hire,
By desperate death of bloody sword in fight.
The rout which sought with flaming fire to light,
Our royal Palace great, who would assign
Their Prince what he should doe: and pull in fine
Our mate from vs dissolving wedlock bands:
Whose hardy slanderous tongs, &amp; wicked hands,
His princely grace reprochfully withstands,
From due revenge, are they dismissed frée?
Shall subjects payne, by grief assigned bée?
It shall assign which time shall never wear.
Which neither wrath may end, nor yet our fear?
Shée shall appease our hie displeased mind,
Who first, our wrath deserved due to find.
Declare whose death your mood doth most require
Let not my hand be stayde from your desire.
It seeks our sisters death, and traitorous head.
Those words through all my limbs, hath stiffness spread,
Oppressed with grisly fear:
Us to obey
Stands thou in doubt?
On faith why do you lay
So great a fault?
Because thou sparedst our foe.
Deserves a woman to be termed so?
If treason she begin.
Is any man
So sure, that his accuse of treason can?
The peoples rage:
Those mad vnweldie wights
Who ordre could?
Who could stir up their spritz?
No creature as I think.
A woman could,
In whom a mind Dame nature hath vpfould,
To mischief prone: shée armed hath his hart,
To hurt by miles: yet strength shée set a part,
Least shée undaunted force with his should bear:
But now his slender power with doubting fear,
Is quickly quaylde, or else with punishment,
Which his condemned state to mischief bent,
To late doth end: away with grave advise,
Us with entreating séeke not to entice.
Dispatch that we command on shipboorde borne,
Far off to shore aloof with dashing worn,
Command she be: that tunlike swelling breast
At length in storming stomach may take rest.
A Lack the peoples bitter love,
And dire good will to many one,
Which, when they hoisted sails aboue,
With pleasant blasts it made to groan,
And carried them far from quiet shore,
That fainting, leaves them in the déepe,
And tombling, raging waters roar.
Cornelia piteous wretch, did wéepe,
And sore bewail his sons estate:
The peoples love did undo them,
And wondrous favour, bred them hate:
Great worthy péeres of noble stem:
Of high renown for virtues praise:
In faith and eloquence both did pas
Their stomachs stout their fame did raise:
Ith laws eche one most excellent was.
And Scipio, thée did fortune yéelde
Unto like death, and cursed wrack,
Whom neither honours pomp could shéelde,
Nor fenced house thy foes keep back.
More to repeat, although I could,
Pure present grief forbids sore:
Ere while to whom the people would,
His Fathers antique court restore,
And Brothers wedlock once again,
Now wéeping, wringing hands poor wretch,
Unto his cruel, deadly pain,
The armed soldiers do his fetch.
How safe doth poverty lye content,
In thetched house safe shrouded theare?
Hie raised towers with blasts are bent,
Which often times them over bear.
Where pull you me poor wretch? alas,
Into what banished exiles place,
Would Narrow have mée for to pas,
Or fortune bids, with frowning face?
If now with fainting strength quite cooled,
And with my broils all wearied cease,
And longer life shée grant me would,
If that shée work for to increase,
My sorrows great with deadly dart,
Why is shée then so much my foe,
In country that I may not part,
And leave my life before I go?
But now no help of health I feel,
Alas I sée my Brothers boat:
This is the same, whose vaulted kéele,
His Mother once did set a float.
And now his piteous Sister I,
Excluded clean from spousal place,
Shall be so carried by and by:
No force hath virtue in this case,
No Gods there be my woes to wreck.
The grisly, dreadful drab Erin,
Doth weld the world at nod and beck,
Who can lament my state, wherein
I am, alas, sufficiently?
How can Aëdon duly plain,
My smarting streams of tears that I
Do shed? whose wings I would be fine,
If destnies would them grant, to wear.
Then would I leave my mourning mates,
As swiftly fled, as wings could bear,
And so avoid these bloody pates.
Then sitting sole in sherwood shirle,
And hanging sure, by dandling twig
With plaintive pipe I might out twirl
My heavy tuned note so big.
The mortal brood the destnies guide:
Them selves they nothing can assure,
That certainly doth steadfast bide:
Which our last day of life, procure,
(Whereof we always should beware,)
Much dangerous chances for to try:
Unto your troubled mind with care,
Now many samples doe apply,
Which your accursed court hath brought,
To bolton you in all your broil:
For what hath more your troubles wrought,
What doth against you sorer toil,
Than fortune doth? thee first of all,
Agrippas child brought forth to life,
Whom we Tyberius daughter call,
By law, and eke Prince Cesars wife,
Of many sons a careful dame,
I cannot choose but now recount,
Whose worthy, glorious, ample name,
Throughout the world doth much surmount.
So oft with belly bolne that bare
Desired fruits, and peaces pledge,
Ere long thou suffredst exiles care,
Strypes, chains, and bolts of iron wedge,
And mourning much, which so did frame,
That death they caused thée to abide.
So Levy, Drusus lucky dame
In male kind babes, did hedling slyde,
Into a cruel monstrous déede,
And death sore piercing deadly dart.
His Mothers fates doth Iulia speed,
To follow straight with all his hart,
Who after longer wasted time
With bloody fashion kene, was slain,
Although for no just cause, or crime.
Your Mother eke that once did reign,
Who then estéemd of Claudius well,
Did wisely weld his court at will,
And fruitful was, as you can tell,
What could not his desire fulfil?
Shée sometime subject to his slave,
To death was put with soldiers blade.
What shée, that casly hope might have,
Toth skies, his reign to rise have made,
Prince Neros lusty parent great?
First tossed with shipman's boisterous force,
Then torn with sword in Princes heat,
Did shée not lye a senseless corse?
Lo me the tyrant stern will send
To yrcksome shades, and hellish spritz.
Why wretch do I the time thus spend?
Draw me to death you to whose myghts,
False fortune hath bequeathed mée.
I witness now the heavenly power.
What doest thou bedlam? leave to flée,
With prayer to Gods, who on thée lower.
I call to witness Tartar déepe,
And sprites of Hell revenging freaks
Of heinous facts, in dungeon stéepe,
And Sire whom death deserved wreakes.
I do not now rapine to dye,
Deck up your ship, and hoise your sail,
On frothing seas to winds on hie:
Let him that guides the helm not fail,
To séeke the shore of Pharian land.
O pippling puff of western wind,
Which sacrifice did once withstand,
Of Iphigen to death assigned:
And close in cloud congealed clad,
Did carry his from smoking ares,
Which angry, cruel Virgin had:
This prince also oppressed with cares,
Save from this painful punishment,
To Deans temple safely borne:
The barbarous Mores to rudeness bent,
Then Princes courts in Rome forlorn,
Have far more civil courtesy:
For there doth strangers death appease
The angry Gods in heavens on hie,
But Romaine blood, our Rome must please

Nulla tam modesta felicitas est
Quae malignantis dentes vitare posit.
NO state of man, he it never so modest,
Never so vnrebukeable and blameless,
No person, be he never so good and honest▪
Can escape at any season now harmless,
But the wicked teeth of such as be shameless,
Are ready most maliciously him for to byte,
Like as Ualerius in his fourth book doth write.
We and other persons have exercised
This comely and good faculty a long season,
Which of some have been spitefully despised,
Wherefore I think they can allege no reason,
Where affect rules, there good iudgemēt is geason.
They never learned the verse of Horace doubtless,
Nec tua laudabis •••dia, aut alien reprehends,
Thou shalt neither praise thine own industry,
Nor yet the labour of other men reprehend,
The one proceeded of a proud arrogance,
And the other from envy, which doth discommend,
All things that virtuous persons doe intend.
For evil will never said well, they do say,
And worse tungs were never heard before this day.
I marvel why they should detract our faculty:
We have ridden and gone many sundry ways,
Yea, we have used this feat at the university,
Yet neither wise nor learned would it dispraise:
But it hath ben perceived ever before our days.
That foals love nothing worse thā foals to be called,
A horse will kick if you touche where he is galled.
Doth not our faculty learnedly extol virtue?
Doth it not teach, God to be praised aboue al thing▪
What faculty doth vice more earnestly subdue?
Doth it not teach true obedience to the king?
What godly sentences to the mind doth it bring?
I say, there was never thing invented
More worth, for mans solace to be frequented,
Hipocrites that wold not have their fautes reveled
Imagine slander our faculty to let,
Fine wold they have their wickedness still concealed
Therefore maliciously against vs they be set,
O (say they) much money they doe get.
Truly I say, whether you give halfpence or pence,
Your gain shall be double, before you depart hence.
Is wisdom no more worth than a penny trow you?
Scripture calls the price thereof incomparable.
Here may you learn godly Sapience now,
Which to body and soul shall be profitable▪
To no person truly we covet to be chargeable,
For we shall think to have sufficient recompense,
If ye take in good worth our simple diligence.
In this matter which we are about to recite,
The ignorant may learn what is true believe,
Whereof the Apostles of Christ do largely write,
Whose instructions here to you we will give,
Here an example of penance the heart to grieve,
May be learned, a love which from Faith doth spring,
Authority of Scripture for the same we will bring.
Of the Gospel we shall rehearse a fruietfull story,
Written in the .vii. of Luke with words plain
The story of a woman that was right sorry
For that she had spent her life in sin vile and vain,
By Christ's preaching she was converted again,
To be truly penitent by his fruits she declared,
And to show his self a sinner she never spared.
His name was called Mary of Magdalene,
So named of the title of his possession,
Out of his Christ rejected .vii. spirits unclean,
As Mark and Luke make open profession.
Doctors of high learning, wit, and discretion,
Of his divers and many sentences doe write,
Which in this matter we intend now to recite.
Of the place aforesaid, with the circumstance,
Only in this matter (God willing) we will treat.
Where we will show that great was his repentance,
And that his love towards Christ was also as great.
His sin did not his conscience so grievously fret,
But that Faith erected his heart again to believe,
That God for Christs sake wold all his sins forgive.
We desire no man in this point to be offended,
In that virtues with vice we shall here introduce,
For in men and women they have depended:
And therefore figuratively to speak, it is the use.
I trust that all wise men will accept our excuse.
Of the Preface for this season here I make an end,
In godly mirth to spend the time we doe intende.
WIth heigh down down and down a down a,
Saluator mundi Domino, Kyrieleyson,
Ite Missa est, with pipe up Alleluia.
Sed libera nos à malo, and so let vs be at one.
Then every man brought in his own dish,
Lord God we had wonderful good fare,
I warrant you there was plenty of flesh and fish,
Go to, I beshrew your heart and if you spare.
A gods name I was set up at the hye deace,
Come up sir, said every body unto me:
Like an honest man I had the first mes,
Glad was he that might my proper person see.
When we had dined, every man to horseback,
And so up unto the mount of Caluarie,
I trow you never heard of such a knack,
Much woe had some of vs to scope the pillory.
But when we came to hye Jerusalem,
Who then but I moister Infidelity?
Mary I was not so called among them,
No, I have a name more nigher the verity.
In Jury, Moysaicall Justice is my name,
I would have them justified by the law,
It is plain infidelity to believe the same,
What then? from the faith I doe them withdraw.
There is one come into the country of late,
Called Christ the son of God, the Jaws Mossies
Of the kingdom of God he begins to prate,
But he shall never bring his purpose to pass,
No, I Infidelity stick so much in the Jaws harts,
That his doctrine and wonders they will not believe,
I warrant that the chief rulers in these parts,
Will devise somewhat his body to mischeue.
Infidelity, no beware of me Infidelity,
Like as Faith is the root of all goodness,
So am I the head of all iniquity,
The well and spring of all wickedness.
Mary sir, yet I convey my matters clean,
Like as I have a visor of virtue,
So my imps, which unto my person do lean,
The visor of honesty doth endue.
As these, Pride I use to call cleanliness,
Envy I colour with the face of prudence,
Wrath puts on the coat of manliness,
Covets is profit in every mans sentence.
Sloth or idleness I paint out with quiet,
Gluttony or excess I name honest chere,
Lechery used for many men's diet,
I set on with the face of love both far and ne'er.
How say you to Infidelity once again?
Infidelity all men's hearts doe occupy:
Infidelity now aboue true Faith doth remain,
And shall do to the worlds end, I think verily.
Yea, that same Mossies doth many things,
Yet I will so occupy the rulers minds,
Both of bishops, phariseys, elders and kings,
That few or none of them shall be his friends.
I beshrew his heart naughty foolish knave,
The most bungarliest tailers in this country,
That be in the world I think, so God me save,
Not a garment can they make for my degree.
Have you ever scene an ouerbody thus sit?
Now a mischief on his drunken knaves ear▪
The knaves drink till they have lost their wit,
And then they mar utterly a bodies gear.
I had liefer than .xx. shillings by this light
That I had him here now in my fume and heate.
What, I am ashamed to come in any mans sight,
Think you in the waste I am so great?
Nay by gis twenty shillings I dare hold,
That there is not a gentlewoman in this land,
More propre than I in the waste I dare be bold,
They be my garments that so bungarly do stand.
Beshrew his heart once again with all my hart,
Is this gear no better than to cast away?
Let him trust to it, I will make him to smart.
For marring of my gear he shall surely pay.
God forbid mistress Mary, &amp; you so tender &amp; young
For marring of your gear he is greatly to blame.
What have you to do, hold your babbling tong,
Have you any thing to doe with the same?
These unhappy tailors I trow be acurst,
Most cōmonly when they make gentlewomēs gear
In the midst they set the piece that is worst.
Yea that is the fashion of them every where.
The worst piece is in the midst of your garment,
And it is pieced into it so unhappily,
That by my truth it is past amendment,
Meddle with it, and you spyll it utterly.
Speak you in ernest, or I pray you do you mock▪
Trow you that my garment can not be amended?
Mock? I know that you come of a worshipful stock
He that mocks you ought to be reprehended.
Of tailors craft I tell you I have some skill,
And if I should meddle with ye piece that is in the midst,
I should make it worse or at the least as ill:
Therefore to let it alone as it is, I judge it best,
Nought it is, and so you may wear it out,
Though it be new, it will be soon worn.
It were almose to hang such a foolish lout,
All they that see me now, will laugh me to scorn,
No gentlewoman is ordered in this wise,
My maidens on the other side are such sluts,
That if I should not for mine own clothes devise,
Within a while they would not be worth a couple of nuts
Of my troth it were pity in mine opinion
But that your gear should be well trimmed,
For you are well favoured, and a pretty minion,
Feat, clean made, well compact, and aptly lymmed.
In Jerusalem there is not I dare say,
A sweter countenance, nor a more loving face,
Fresh and flourishing as the flowers in May,
I have not scene a gētlewomā of a more goodly grace
Your parents I know, were very honourable,
Which have left you worshipfully to live here,
And certainly I judge it very commendable.
That with your own you can make good chere.
I thank you for your good word gentle friend,
And forasmuch as you did know my parents,
I can no less doe than love you with all my mind,
Ready to do you pleasure at your cōmandementes.
Verb puellatum follies leuiora caducis,
The promise of maidens, the Poet doth say,
Be as stable as a weak leaf in the wind,
Like as a small blast blows a feather away,
So a fair word truly changes a maidens mind.
Forsooth I thank you, O loving worm, good lord,
Yea, I knew your fathers state and condition,
The nobility of Jury can bear me record,
That he was a man of a worshipful disposition.
I wis mistress Marie, I had you in mine arms,
Before you were .iii. years of age without doubt,
I preserved you many times from sore harms,
Which in your childhode your enemies went about.
A gentlewoman of noble birth as I doe think
Should have servants always at her cōmaundemēt,
You are able to give to many both meat and drink,
Yea honest wages, and also necessary raiment.
I perceive right well that you owe me good will,
Tendering my worshipful state and dignity:
You see that I am young and can little skill
To provide for mine own honour and utility.
Wherefore I pray you in all things counsel to have,
After what sort I may lead a pleasant life here,
And look what it pleases you of me to crave,
I will give it you gladly, as it shall appear.
Say you so mistress Mary, will you put me in trust
In faith I will tell you, you can not trust a wiser,
You shall live pleasantly, even at your hearts lust,
If you make me your counsellor and deuiser.
Remember that you are young and full of dalliance
Lusty, courageous, fair, beautiful and wise.
I will have you to attempt all kinds of pastance,
Using all pleasure at your own hearts devise.
Do you think that it is not more than madness,
The lusty and pleasant life of a mans youth,
Miserably to pass away in study and sadness,
It is extreme folly mistress Mary for a truth.
Be ye merry, and put away all fantasies,
One thing is this, you shall never be younger in dede,
Your bodily pleasure I would have you to exercise,
Sure you are of worldly substance never to need.
Certainly my parents brought me up in chyldhod,
In virtuous qualities, and godly literature,
And also they bestowed upon me much good
To have me nourtred in noble ornature.
But evermore they were unto me very tender,
They would not suffer the wind on me to blow,
My requests they would always to me render,
Whereby I knew ye good will that to me they did owe.
At their departing, their goods they distributed
Among vs their children, whom they did well love.
But me as their dearlyng, they most reputed,
And gave me the greatest part, as it did behove.
Puellae pestis, indulgency parentum,
Of parents the tender and carnal sufferance,
Is to young maidens a very pestilence.
It is a provocation and furtherance,
Unto all lust and fleshly concupiscence.
O mistress Mary, your parents did see,
That you were beautiful and well favoured:
They did right well as it seems me,
That so worshipfully they have you furthered.
As I understand, you have in your possession
The whole castle of Magdalene, with the purtenāce,
Which you may rule at your discretion,
And obtain thereby riches in abundance.
O what worldly pleasure can you want,
What commodities have you of your own?
About Jerusalem is not such a plant,
As to me and many other is well known,
It were decent I say, to use the fruition
Of such riches as is left you here,
You never heard in any erudition,
But that one with his own should make good chere.
By my troth so would I, if I perfectly knew
Which way I should good chere making begin,
A lusty disposition from me doth ensue:
But without council, I am not worth a pyn.
Council? in you shall want no council in dede,
I know where a certain company is,
Which can give such council in time of need,
That you following them can never speed amiss.
Now I pray you help me to that company,
And look what I am able to do for your pleasure,
You shall have it I promise you verily,
Yea, whether it be lands, gold, or treasure.
The truth is so, they whom now I speak of,
Are persons of great honour and nobility,
Fellows that love neither to dally nor scoff,
But at once will tell you the verity.
Men of honour say you? tell me I you desire,
Can you cause them trow you shortly to be here?
I will go and provide some other attire,
That according to my birth I may appear.
Birth? faith of my body, you are well arrayed,
I warrant you with these clothes they will be content
They had liefer have you naked, be not afraid,
Then with your best holy day garment.
You are a merry man in dede, you are a wanton,
I will go and return again by and by,
As I am, I would with all my heart be known,
So that I might be pleasant to every mans eye.
I pray you heartily that I may be so bold
To have a kiss or two before you doe depart,
If a kiss were worth a hundred pound of gold,
You should have it even with my very heart.
I thank you mistress Mary by my maidenhood,
Lord what a pleasant kiss was this of you?
Take her with you, I warrant you will never be good
She is given to it, I make God avow.
And I trow I shall help to set her forward.
Shortly my offspring and I shall her so dress,
That neither law nor prophets she shall regard,
No though the son of God to her them express.
Infidelity is my name, you know in dede,
Proprely I am called the Serpents sede,
Loke in whose heart my father Satan doth me sow
There must all iniquity and vice needs grow,
The conscience where I dwell is a receptacle,
For all the devils in hell to have their habitacle,
You shall see, that Maries heart within short space,
For the devil him self shall be a dwelling place,
I will so dress her, that there shall not be a worse.
To her the devil at pleasure shall have his recourse.
I will go and prepare for her such a company,
As shall poison her with all kinds of villainy.
Whether art thou going now Infidelity▪
Pride of Life now welcome, the spring of iniquity,
O pride of life, thou never uses to go alone,
Give me your hands also I pray you one by one.
Welcome pride of life with my whole heart &amp; mind,
And thou art welcome Cupidity mine own friend:
What, mynikin carnal concupiscence,
Thou art welcome heartily by my conscience.
To see thee merry Infidelity I am right glad.
When Infidelity is in health, I can not be sad.
Infidelity? O Infidelity, mine own infidelity,
I am glad to see thee merry now for a surety,
I marvel what thou dost in this place alone,
I thought that out of Jury thou had ben gone.
Out of Jury? no carnal lust to thee I may tell
That with the chief princes now I do dwell:
The bishops, priests and pharisies do me so retain,
That the true sense of the law they do disdain.
In faith there is some knavery in mind,
That here by thy self alone we doe thee find.
Infidelity in our fathers cause is occupied,
As within a while it shall be verified.
Am I▪ you would say so if ye knew all,
I was going forth you to call,
Know you not a wench called Mary Magdalene?
Do I know his? she is a pretty wench and a clean.
Since she had discretion his have I known,
Mary Magdalen (quote he) in dede she is mine own
It is as proud a little girl truly I think,
As ever men saw in this world eat or drink.
And somewhat to do with his now and then I have
I allure his for his own profit always to save.
I have dressed his so well truly I believe,
That already for Gods sake nothing she will give.
For my part in his I have kindled such a fire,
That she begins to burn in carnal desire.
Tush, as yet you have but his mind moved,
Whom she may forsake if she be reproved:
But I would have his cleave unto you so fast.
That she shall not forsake you while her life doth last
If thou be once rooted within the hart,
Then moist thou make an entrance by thy craft &amp; art
So that we may come into his at pleasure,
Filling his with wickedness beyond all measure.
In vs tour without fail be contained
As many vices as ever in this world reigned.
Now if we by thy means may in his remain,
She shall be sure all kinds of vices to contain.
Within my self you know that I contain a sort,
Which by name before you here I will report.
My name is carnal concupiscence or desire,
Which all the pleasures of the flesh doth require.
First the flesh to nourish with drink and meat
Without abstinence like a beast always to eat,
To quasse and drink when there is no necessity,
Joying in excess, bealy chere, and ebrietie.
I contain in my self all kind of lechery,
Fornication, whoredom, and wicked adultery,
Rape, incest, sacrilege, softness, and bestiality,
Blindness of mind, with every such quality,
Inconstancy, headiness, and inconsideration,
After the hearts poison and filthy communication,
So then to the hate of God I do them bring,
Causing a love in himself inordinately to spring.
These and such like I contain in my person.
Thus you see that carnal lust goes never alone.
Thou hast reckned an abominable rabble,
Where thou duellist, the devil may have a stable.
With thee I may boldly compare I trow,
For as many vices in me as in thee do grow.
You know that my name is called Cupidity,
Whom Scripture calls the root of all iniquity,
Infidelity in dede is the seed of all syn,
But cupidity opens the gate, and lets him in:
I contain theft, deceit in selling and bying,
Perjury, rapine, dissimulation, and lying.
Hardiness of heart otherwise called inhumanity,
Inquietnesse of mind falshode and vanity,
In me is all vengeance envy rankor and ire.
Murder, war, treason, and greedy desire.
I contain the wicked vices of usury,
Dice and card playing with all kind of injury.
What mischief was there ever yet or sin,
But that cupidity did it first of all begin?
There can not be a more filthy place in hell,
Than that is, where as cupidity doth dwell.
Yea, there is impiety, the contempt of Gods law,
His word is no more regarded than a vile straw.
You contain vices very wicked in dede,
But how wicked is he, frō whom al syn doth proceed:
The beginning of syn, which doth mā frō god divide
Scripture calls it nothing else but pride.
For I my self not only contain you three,
But all vices in you, and that in every degree,
Pride despises God, and committed idolatry
To God and man Pride is a very adversary,
I am full of boasting, arrogance, and vainglory,
Envious, and of all other men's wealth right sorry:
Pride causes obstinacy, and disobedience,
Yea, it engenders idleness and negligence,
The truth of Gods prophets through tirāts of pride
Hath ever unto this day ben cast aside:
The men of God pride hath spitefully reputed,
And with tyrants always the same persecuted.
Pride would never suffer any virtue to reign,
But oppressed it with great malice and disdain.
In a short sum &amp; few words you shall know all,
Pride caused Lucifer from heaven to hell to fall.
Yea pride lost mankind, and did him so infect,
That God from his favour did him away reject,
Where as pride is, a token it is evident,
That all other vices be even there resident.
Where as you and all your offspring doth dwell,
There is a place for all the devils in hell:
And plain it is, where as is such filthy sin,
There even in this world their hell doth begin.
By such time as with vs Mary be furnished,
With the devil him self she shall be replenished.
In our tragedy we may not use our own names,
For that would turn to al our rebukes and shames.
Pride with all thy abominable store,
At this time must be called Nobility and honour.
Very well, for these women that be vicious,
Are always high minded and ambitious.
Never woman that could play a harlots part,
Was either humble, or yet meke in hart.
Yea and the same loved always cupidity,
Therefore thy name shall be called Utility.
For him a better name you could not express,
For ill disposed women are always merciless.
They are always scraping, clawing, &amp; gathering,
To maintain their lives in wickedness and sin.
Carnal concupiscence shall be called pleasure,
And that pretty Marie loves beyond all measure.
Infidelity may not be called infidelity.
No, we will work with a little more austerity,
Infidelity for divers respects hath names divers,
Of the which some of thē to you I purpose to rehearse
With bishops, priests, scribes, seniors and pharisies,
And with as many as be of the Jaws degrees,
I am called Legal Justice commonly:
For why by the law them selves they do justify.
It is plain Infidelity so to believe:
Therefore there, such a name to my self I do give.
I have a garment correspondent to that name,
By the which I walk among them without blame.
With publicans and sinners of a carnal pretence,
I am sometime called coūsel, and sometime Prudence.
I cause them the wisdom of God to despise,
And for the flesh and the world wittily to devise,
Prudence before Marie my name I will call.
Which to my suggestions will cause his to fall:
A vesture I have here to this garment correspondēt,
Lo here it is, a gown I trow convenient.
For our honour I pray thee heartily doe it wear.
Mary did talk with me before in this gear,
But because she shall the sooner to me apply,
I will dress me in these garments even by and by.
How think you by me now in this array?
Mary loves them I tell you, that use to go gay.
Then had thou need to mend thy foolish coūtenāce
For thou look like one that hath lost his remēbrāce
With the one eye overmuch thou uses to wink,
That thou meanest some fraud thereby they will think
He that looks with one eye, &amp; winks with an other,
I would not trust (say they) if he were my brother.
Like obstinate Friars I temper my look,
Which had one eye on a wench, and an other on a book
Passion of God, behold, yonder comes Marie.
See that in your tales none from other do vary.
It is a pretty wench that it is in dede,
Much to entreat her, I think we shall not need.
No, for I think she is ill enough of his self,
She seems to be a proud little elf.
I pray you behold how she trimmed her gear?
She would have all well about her every where.
Maidēs (quote she?) there is no gētlewomā I wene
So accumbred as I am, for such were never scene:
Fie on them in good faith they are to bad,
They would make some gentlewoman stark mad.
Like as I put of my gear, so I do it find,
And I can not tel how oft I have told thē my mind,
By the faith of my body if they do not amend,
To lay them on the bones surely I do intend.
Maxima quaequae domus, seruis est plane superbis,
Every great house, as the Poet doth say,
Is full of naughty servants both night and day.
You say truth sir in dede, what old acquaintance?
Now forsooth you were out of my remembrance:
You have changed your array since I was here,
I am glad to see you merry and of a good chere.
And I of yours mistress Mary with hart &amp; mind
It is a joy to see a gentlewoman so loving and kind
Shall I be so bold to kiss you at our meting?
What else? it is an honest manner of greeting.
Pleases it you to bid these gentlemen welcome?
Yea forsooth, are they heartily all and some.
I will kiss you all for this gentleman's sake,
He is a friend of mine as I do him take.
He is in dede, you may be sure mistress Mary,
There is no man living can say the contrary.
He hath ben diligent to seek vs together,
And for your sake he hath caused vs to come hither.
I dare say thus much, that he is your friend,
For he loves you with his whole heart and mind.
He hath ben diligent about your cause,
As it had been his own, and would never pause,
Till he had performed his desired request.
Which I am able to say is very honest.
A gentle friend at so little acquaintance,
Will you •ooke so much unto my furtherance?
It seems then if by me you had ben benefited,
You would have my kindness gently requited.
Quo magic la, magic aestuat ignis
The more closely that you keep fire, no doubt
The more fervent it is when it breaks out.
Well friend, I know what you mean by that verse
What I will do for you at this time I will not rehearse
But in one thing truly I am much to blame,
That all this time I have not inquired your name.
Sweet mistress Mary, I am called Prudence,
Or else Counsel, full of wisdom and science,
Here unto you, honourable Honour I have brought,
A person always to be in your mind and thought,
And this person is named Utility,
Very profitable for your commodity,
Pleasure is the name of this Minion,
Convenient for you forsooth in mine opinion.
Prudence, Honour, Utility, and Pleasure,
Oh who would desire in this world more treasure,
Gramercy heart of gold for your great payne,
Truly of necessity, I must kiss you once again.
Will you so? that is the thing that have I wold,
Every kiss to me is worth a crown of gold.
Leave kissing, &amp; treat we of matters more ernest.
Let vs reason of things concerning your request.
Honour is my name, a quality for you requisite,
Or rather of honour I am an appetite:
On the which must be all your meditation,
With the hearts courage and minds elevation:
I tell you this desire must be ever next your hart.
Nay hoe there, backare, you must stand apart,
You love me best I trow, mistress Mary.
For a hundred pound I would not say the contrary
And in token Prudence that I love you best,
Here I join you next unto my heart and breast.
If ye embrace one, you must all embrace,
For our use is to dwell all in one place.
Tush from our purpose always we do digress,
Let every one of vs his qualities express.
Agreed, mistress Mary hear you my counsel.
First, all thought from your heart you must expel.
Trouble not your self with any fantasies,
Never attend you to the law nor prophecies.
They were invented to make fools afraid,
Hear them not, for they will make you dismayed.
God? tush, when was God to any man scene,
I had not ben now alive, if any God had been.
Homo la Deus.
Man, is God to man this matter is plain,
And believe you that none other God doth reign.
Man is the beginning of his own operation:
Ergo then of none other gods creation,
Man is his own God therefore with utility,
Let him labour here to live in felicity.
Of many ladies I am certain you have hard,
Which the people as goddesses did regard:
And why▪ this was the cause truly in my judgment,
They had all pleasure here at their cōmaundement,
So that they lived in joy wealth and prosperity,
Using all pleasures for their own commodity.
To be a goddess your self truly you must believe,
And yt you may be so, your mind thereto you must give
All other gods beside your self you must despise,
And set at nought their Scripture in any wise.
How say you M. Mary do we not gre all in one?
Surely M. Mary we will make you a Goddess anon.
You please me exceedingly well verily,
Persons you are of great wit and policy.
You must be proud, lofty, and of hye mind,
Despise the poor, as wretches of an other kind:
Your countenance is not ladylike enough yet.
I see well that we had need to teach you more wit.
Let your eyes roll in your head, declaring your pride,
After this sort you must cast your eyes aside.
How think you by this manner of countenance?
Conueniēt for such as be not of your acquaintance.
I doubt not but she will do right well his part,
By that time that all we be fast within his hart,
Mark the garments of other in any wise,
And be you sure of one of the newest guise.
Your hair me think is as yellow as any gold,
Upon your face laid about have it I wold.
Sometime on your forehead the breadth of an hand,
Sometime let your attire upon your crown stand,
That all your hair for the most part may be in sight,
To many a man a fair hair is a great delight.
In summer time now and then to keep away flies,
Let some of that fair hair hang in your eyes:
With a hot nedle you shall learn it to crisp,
That it may curl together in manner like a wisp.
By my troth you are a merry gentleman,
I will follow your counsel as much as I can.
By your ears sometimes with pretty tusks &amp; toys
You shall fold your hair like Tomboys.
It becomes a young gentlewoman be ye sure,
And young men unto your love it will allure.
If the colour of your hair begins for to fade,
A craft you must have▪ that yellow it may be made,
With some Goldsmith you may your self acquaint,
Of whō you may have water your hair for to paint.
Besides Goldsmiths water, there is other gear,
Very good also to colour again the hear,
Yea, if you were not beautiful of your visage,
A painter could make you to apere with a lusty courage
And though you were as aged as any creature,
A Painter on your face would set such an ornature,
That you should seem young and very fair,
And like one whose beauty doth never despair.
M. Mary, had you never ye small pore in your youth?
You are a mad fellow Prudence, of a truth.
I pray you M. Prudence▪ wherefore ask you that?
It is l•ke that in you he hath spied somewhat
Alas good gentlewoman, she blushes like coals.
In dede about her nose there be little pretty holes,
Therefore I thynk that she hath had the pockes,
I mean good faith without any gauds or mocks.
If there be any fautes in my face verily,
For money I trust shortly to have remedy.
Mistress Mary there is not a fairer in this town.
Yea by saint Anne she is lovely in color, but brown.
If she be not content with that native colour,
A painter will set on one of more honour.
I have known painters that have made old crones
To appear as pleasant as little pretty young Iones.
Let vs return again to our ornaments,
I would have you pleasant always in your garments
Upon your forehead you must wear a bon grace,
Which like a penthouse may com far over your face,
And an other from your nose unto your throat,
Of velvet at the least, without spot or moat,
Your garments must be so worn always,
That your white paps may be seen if you may.
If young gentlemen may see your white skin,
It will allure them to love, and soon bring them in.
Both damsels and wives use many such feats,
I know them that will lay out their fair teates,
Purposely men to allure unto their love,
For it is a thing that doth the heart greatly move.
At such sights of women I have known men in dede
That with talking &amp; beholding their noses will blede▪
Through great courage moved by such goodly sights▪
Labouring the matter further with al their myghts.
Your words do not only provoke my desire,
But in pleasure they set my heart on fire.
Sometime for your pleasure you may wear a past▪
But aboue all th•n is gyrd your self in the waste,
Upon your over body you may nothing else wear,
But an vnliued garment without any other gear.
Let your body be pent, and together strained,
As hard as may be, though thereby you be pained.
Use will make the thing easy there is no doubt.
Yea pardie gentlewomen use it now all about.
Your nether garmēts must go by gymmes &amp; joints
Aboue your buttocks they must be tied on with points.
Some women a doublet of fine linen use to wear
Unto the which they tie their other nether gear,
With wiers &amp; houpes your garments must be made,
Pleasure your minion shall show you in what trade.
In the wast I will have ye as small as a wand.
Yea so small, that a man may span you with his hand.
It skills not though in the buttocks you be great
No for there she is like many times to be beat.
Well wantons well, are ye not ashamed?
In dede mistress, they are worthy to be blamed.
You must rejoice in your riches and good,
And set much by your kindred and noble blood:
Boast of them, and when of them you do talk,
Of their cōmendatiōs let your tong evermore walk.
Daily thus, my lord my father, or mi lady my mother
My lord my uncle, and my moister my brother.
I promise you I come of a stock right honourable,
Therefore my talk of them can not be to cōmendable.
It is a stock (they say) right honourable and good,
That hath neither these nor whore in their blood.
No more words: how say you M. here by pleasure?
Forsooth sweet heart. I love him beyond al measure.
Body of god, for this al this while have I wrought?
By your smirking loke ofttimes on him so I thought
What do you love him better than you love me?
Which of you I should love best truly I can not se.
This is a true proverb, and no fained fable,
Few women's words, be honest, constant, and stable.
Truly M. Mary if ye love me, there is nothing lost,
Love they say, ieopardeth all, and spares for no cost.
Voluptas atom est sola quae nos vocet ad se,
Et aliciat suapte nature,
Pleasure saith one man, of his own nature,
Elects to him every human creature:
Now what person soever doth pleasure hate,
As a beast is to be objected both early and late.
Let me have a word or two in your ear.
How say you by that, like you not that pretty gear?
Ha, ha, ha, you are a fond body pleasure verily.
Doth he not move you to matrimony?
Take heed that he bring you not to such dotage,
For many incommodities truly be in marriage.
Semper habent lites, alter{que} iurgia lectus,
In quo nupta iacet minimum dormitur in illo,
The bed wherein lies any married wife,
Is never without chiding, brawling, and strife,
That woman shall never sleep in quiet,
Which is married contrary to his diet.
Of all bondage truly this is the ground,
A gentlewoman to one husband to be bound.
Tush mistress Mary, be ye not in subjection,
Better it is to be at your own election.
What thing in this world excelled liberty?
Neither gold nor treasure for a surety.
Take you now one, and then an other hardly,
Such as for the time will to you lovingly apply.
That will be a mean truly to less my good name.
And so among the people I shall suffer blame.
Ye shall not keep my counsel, if ye can not keep your own
Can you not make good chere, but it must be known?
As touching that, I will be to you such a mean,
As shall teach you always to convey the matter clean
Take you none but gentlemen with velvet coats,
It is to be thought, that they are not without groats
In any wise see that your lovers be young and gay,
And such fellows as be well able to pay.
Nay truly if I should attempt any such gear,
I would take where I loved always here and there.
Spoken like a worthy sweet girl by the mass,
I warrant all this gear will well come to pass.
You must ever have a tongue well filed to flatter,
Let your garments be sprinkled with rose water.
Use your civet, pommander, musk, which be to sell,
That the odor of you a mile of, a man may smell,
With sweet ointments such as you can appoint,
Use you evermore your propre body to anoint.
With fine meats &amp; pure wines do your body norish
That will cause you in all pleasure to flourish:
And when one for your mind you can espy,
Use a smiling countenance and a wanton eye.
Upon all such as ye mind not, look you aloft,
To them that be not of your diet be you not soft.
Ha, ha, ha, laugh▪ now I pray God I dye if ever I did se,
Such pleasant companions as you all be.
You speak of many things here of pleasure,
Which to use truly requires much treasure.
If you can wisely occupy this pretty gear,
I will warrant you to get an hundred pound a year.
Hold up the market, and let them pay for the ware,
Be ever catching and taking, doe you not spare.
I may use dalliance and pastime a while,
But the courage of youth will soon be in exile.
I remember yet since I was a little fool,
That I learned verses when I went to school,
Which be these:
Form bone fragilis est, quantum ass••t ad anno•▪
••t minor, &amp; spacio carpitur isle suo,
Nec semper viola, nec semper lily florent,
Et riget amiss spine relicta rosa.
The pleasure of youth is a thing right frail,
And is yearly less, so that at length it doth fail,
The sweet violets and lilies flourish not always:
The rose soon dries, and lasts not a day.
I see in other women by very experience,
That the time of youth hath no long permanence.
In good faith when ye are come to be an old maude,
Then it will be best for you to play the bawd.
In our country there be such old mother bees,
Which are glad to cloak bawdry for their fees.
This is the order, such as were harlots in their youth
May use to be bawds evermore for a truth.
When the courage of them is altogether past,
In age they use to get their living with such a cast.
Tush, your friends have left you honest possessiōs,
Which you may employ after such discretions,
That a worshipful state you may maintain,
Besides that, with the other feat you may gain.
Oppress your tenants, take fines, and raise rentes,
Hold up your houses and lands with their contents.
Bye by great measure, and sell by small measure,
This is a way to amplify your treasure:
Sell your ware for double more than it is worth,
Though it be stark nought, yet put it forth.
A thousand castes to enrich you I can tell,
If you be content to use always my counsel.
Yes by the faith of my body, else I were not wise,
For my profit is your counsel and devise.
How say you mistress Mary, tell vs your mind,
To embrace vs &amp; love vs can you in your heart find?
Truly hart rote I love you all .iiii. with al my hart,
Trusting that none of vs from other shall depart.
In token whereof, I embrace you in mine arms,
Trusting that you will defend me from all harms.
Will we? yea we will see so for your prosperity,
That you shall live in joy and felicity.
I will see that you shall have good in abundance,
To maintain you in all pleasure and dalliance.
And new kinds of pastime I will invent,
With the which I trust ye shall be content.
Mistress Mary can you not play on ye virginals?
Yes sweet heart that I can, and also on the regals,
There is no instrument but that handle I can,
I think as well as any gentlewoman.
If that you can play upon the recorder,
I have as fair a one as any is in this border,
Truly you have not scene a more goodly pipe,
It is so big that your hand can it not gripe.
Will you be so good as to play vs a dance?
And we will do you as great pleasure it may chance.
Alas we have no such instrument here.
I know where you may have all such gear.
No instruments nor pastime that you can require,
But I can bring you unto it at your desire.
Will you take the payne to go before thither?
And mistress Mary and we will come together.
How say you mistress Mary, are you content?
Look what you will do, I will thereto assent.
I think it best that we .iii. depart hence,
And let mistress Mary com thither with Prudence.
Be it so, then you and I will come alone,
I trust that by the way we will make one,
Nay M. Mary we must have a song of .iiii. parts
At your departing to rejoice our merry hearts.
The treble you shall moister Pleasure sing
So freshly that for joy your heart shall spring.
Utility can sing the base full clean,
And Noble Honour shall sing the mean.
Mistress Mary will you help to sing a part?
Yea sweet heart with you with all my hart.
In faith we will have a song of your name.
Come sirs, help I pray you to sing the same.
Hey dairy, dairy, with a lusty dairy,
Hoigh mistress Mary, I pray you be merry.
Your pretty person we may compare to Lais,
A morsel for princes and noble kings,
In beauty you excel the fair lady Thais,
You exceed the beautiful Helene in all things,
To behold your face who can be weary?
Hoigh mistress Mary, I pray you be merry.
The hair of your head shines as the pure gold,
Your eyes as gray as glass and right amiable,
Your smiling countenance so lovely to behold,
〈…〉 all is most pleasant and delectable,
Of your commendations who can be weary?
Huff mistress Mary, I pray you be merry.
Your lips as ruddy as the red Rose,
Your teeth as white as ever was the whales bone,
So clean, so sweet, so fair, so good, so fresh, so gay,
In all Jury truly at this day there is none.
With a lusty voice sing we Hey dairy dairy.
Huff mistress Mary, I pray you be merry.
Such pleasant cōpanions I have not scene before,
Now I pray you let vs dwell together evermore.
To your heart we are so fast conglutinate,
That from thence we shall never be separate.
Yet from your sight at this time we will depart,
Assuring you to remain styll in our hart.
We three will go before some thing to prepare,
That shall be to your commodity and welfare.
Fare you well my hearts joy, pleasure, and bliss.
It is good manner at our departing to kiss.
I must kiss to, if I tarry styll.
You shall have kisses enough, even when you will.
Gramercy in dede mine own good loving Jug
It doth me good in mine arms you to hug,
How say you now by these minions?
I say as you say in dede they are minions,
And such persons as long time I have desired,
I thank you, that for me you have them inquired.
You must think on the counsel that they did give,
They will perform their sayings you shall believe.
I am not oblivious I warrant you my friend,
For I have printed all their words in my mind,
I have determined by them to direct my life,
So that no man shall be able to set vs at strife.
Will you resort with me unto Jerusalem?
There we shall be sure in a place to find them.
A banquet they have prepared for you I dare say,
Such a one as hath not ben scene before this day.
Alas why do they such great cost on me bestow?
Truly because you their good hearts should know.
There is nothing lost that is done for such a friend,
I wis mistress Mary, I wold you knew al my mind
Gentle Prudence if you have any thing to say,
Break your mind boldly to me as you go by ye way.
Will you come? you had need to go but softly,
Take heed, for the way is foul and slippery:
If never so little backward you chance to slip,
Up into your saddle forsooth I am ready to skip.
Go wanton, get you forth with sorrow,
We shall be at Jerusalem I think to morrow.
I thought surely yt here we should have found him,
It was showed me that he was here about in dede.
The last weke he was at the City of Naim,
And from thens I wot not whether he did proceed.
He did a marvelous act there, as we heard say,
For the which the people do him greatly praise:
Marvels he works almost every day.
At Naim a dead child again he did raise.
All things he doth by the power of the great devil,
And that you may see by his conversation,
He kepeth company with such as be evil,
And with them he hath his habitation:
A friend of sinners, and a drinker of wine,
Never conversant with such as be honest,
Against the law he teaches a doctrine,
All holy Religion he doth detest,
The reverend bishops and you the pharisies,
He calls hipocrites, and doth you revile,
So he doth the doctors and scribes of all degrees▪
Beside that, the Saboth also he doth defile.
He uses as great blasphemy as ever was,
The son of the living God he doth himself call,
He saith that he is the very same Mossies,
Prophesied before of the Prophets all.
I promise you right worshipful Simon,
Your temple, law, and people shall be made captive,
If in this sort he be suffered alone,
And you shall lose all your prerogative.
We the fathers of the clergy divers seasons,
About him have consulted together,
To destroy him we have alleged reasons,
But many things therein we do consider.
His doctrine is marvelous this is true,
And his works are more marvelous doubtless,
If as yet we should chance him to pursue,
Much inconvenience might chance and distress,
The people do him for a great Prophet take,
He doth so much good among them that be sick,
That they wot not what on him to make,
For he heals both the mad and the lunatike.
Me think verily, that it doth you behove,
Which are men of learning and intelligence,
His doctrine and miracles wisely to prove,
And whence he had them to have experience.
By my faith I will tell you what was my pretence,
To have bidden him to diner this day I thought,
Where we would have examined his science,
And by what power such wonders he wrought.
But if I can not have him in my house this day,
I will appoint an other day for the same cause.
Then will we appoint for him some other way
If we find him contrary to our laws.
No credos tempori, trust not the time he doth say,
I fear that you will permit him to long:
There is ever peril in much delay,
Never suffer you to reign ought that is wrong.
Well, saying that at this time he doth not appear,
I will return hence as fast as I may,
Take you the payne a while to tarry here
To see if he chance at any time to come this way,
Or if you here where he is resident,
Let vs have word as fast as ever you can.
As concerning your request I will be diligent,
To doe you pleasure evermore I am your man.
It shall cost me a fall I promise him truly,
Except I bring him shortly to an end.
Watch for him will I, in all places duly,
I will know what the merchant doth intende.
A beggarly wretch, that hath not of his own,
One house or cabin wherein he may rest his head:
His parents for poor laboring folks are well known,
And have not ye things which should stand thē in stead
No man knows where he learned &amp; went to school
And yet he takes upon him to teach men doctrine.
But within a while he will prove him self a fool,
And come to utter destruction and ruin.
Is he able, think you, to withstand,
So many bishops, priests, and pharisies,
Great learned men, and seniors of the land,
With other people that be of their affinites?
His folly by his presumption he doth declare,
A while we are content that he doth reign.
But I trust to make him weary of his welfare,
If I may see him in this country again.
Ha, ha, ha, laugh quote he? laugh I must in dede,
I never saw a bolder harlot in my life,
To prompt his forward we shall not need,
No point of sin but that in his is rife.
Infidelity? what a devil doest thou here?
I had not known thee but by thy voice.
Malicious judgment I pray thee what chere,
To see thee merry at my heart I doe rejoice.
What a devil meanest thou by this gear?
This garment is not of the wonted fashion.
For every day I have a garment to wear,
According to my work and operation,
Among the Pharisies, I have a Pharisies gown,
Among publicans and sinners an other I use,
I am best I tell thee now, both in city and town,
And chiefly among the people of the Jaws.
This is the cause their Mossies, whō Christ they call
Is come into the world, sinners to forgive.
Now my labour is both with great and small,
That none of them do him nor his words believe.
The bishops &amp; pharisies I make ye more hard hearted
The sins of them that are disposed to sin,
I augment, so that they can not be converted,
So that hard it will be any grace to win.
Among them Malicious iudgemēt is not my name
The true intellection of the law they doe me call,
Carnally I cause them to understand the same,
And according to their own malice to judge all.
Thou know that among thē I am Justice lega.
For by the deeds of the law they will be justified,
So that the doctrine of the Mossies evangelical,
Shall be despised, and he therefore crucified.
The reverend father Simon the Pharisie,
To have spoken with him, even now was here:
Under the pretence of friendship and amity,
He would bid him to diner, and make him good chere,
Not for any good-will that to him he doth owe,
But to prove his fashion, learning, and power.
Good will quote he▪ No, no that I do know.
For if they durst, he should die within this hour.
But let this pass, I will tell thee what I have done,
Know thou not a wench called Mary Magdalene
Yes mary, I did see her yesterday at noon.
A pretty wench she is in deed and a clean.
I have brought her now into such a case,
That she is past the fear of God and shame of man,
She works privily in every place,
Yea and provokes other thereto now and than,
I would thou did see his disposition,
Thou hast not scene his like I think in thy days.
If she have tasted of thy erudition,
I doubt not but she knows all wicked ways,
To se her fashion I would bestow my forty pence,
But at this time I can no longer tarry here,
About my busynesse I must depart hence,
Seeking for the same Christ both far and ne'er.
Very little I hope for his commodity.
To doe him any good doest thou intende?
Thou know my mind right well Infidelity▪
What need we any more time to spend?
Farewell, thou wilt come to •••er to day,
Moister Symon will have him if it be possible.
Thou know that I dwell with such men always,
For in his heart I am even now invisible.
Well remembered, yet I must provide a garment
Against that I come to my master Symon,
About the which the precepts of the testament
Must be written in order one by one.
Now will I return to my minion again
I may not from his be away absent.
If his company I should a little refrain,
I know well that she would not be content.
Horizon, I beshrowe your heart, are you here?
I may doe what I will for you.
Huff mistress Mary, are you so near?
I thought otherwise I make God avow.
I pray you let me have a word in your ear,
I promise you he is a minion fellow.
By my faith I thought that you had ben there,
For I saw when you did him follow.
By my faith Prudence you have a false eye▪
A body can never so secretly work,
But that their dalliance you will espy,
I trow for the nones you lye in corners and lurk.
But sir, how say you to him in the florin beard?
That is a knave that horizon, wot you what he did▪
In my life was I never worse afraid,
When I came to bed, I found him there hid.
Out alas, quote I, here is some ill spirit,
A sweet savour of musk and civet I smelt,
Come and lye with me Mary quote he, this night,
Then I knew who it was, when his beard I felt.,
I beshrew your hearts, whore &amp; thief were agreed
You knew the spirit well enough before you cam there
I am sure, that so honestly he had you feed,
That the reward did put away the fear.
Good lord, who is this that yonder doth come?
What mean the tables that be in his hand?
Come aside a little, and give him rome,
And what he is anon we shall understand.
The Law of God at this time I do represent,
Written with the finger of God in tables of stone,
Whereby the people might know their lord omnipotēt
And how that he is the Lord God alone.
A peculiar people to him self he had elected,
Coming of the stock of faithful Abraham,
Whom by the law he would have directed,
After that out of Egypt from Pharao they came.
In me as in a glass it doth plainly appear,
What God of his people doth require,
What the peoples duty is, they may see here,
Which they owe unto God in pain of hell fire.
In me is declared the same justice,
Which unto God is acceptable,
Mans sin is here showed, and proud enterprise,
Whereby he is convicted to pains perdurable.
It was necessary and it did behove,
Considering mans pride and temerity,
Which was drunk and blind in his own love,
To make a law to show his imbecility.
Except the law had rebuked his vanity,
So much he would have trusted in his own strength
And believed, that through ye power of his humanity,
He might have obtained salvation at length.
Wherefore as I said to a glass compared I may be,
Wherein clearly as in the sun light,
The weakness and sin of him self he may se,
Yea and his own damnation as it is right.
For the curse of God followed sin always,
And damnation followed malediction:
By this it appears as clear as the day,
That my office is to fill the mind with affliction,
I am a ministration of death working ire,
I show Gods request, and mans vnabilitie,
I condemn him for sin unto eternal fire,
I find not one just of mans fragility.
O Prudence, hear you not what the law doth say,
Exceedingly it pricks my conscience.
I may cry out alas now and welaway,
For I am damned by Gods own sentence.
Prick of cōsciēce, quote she? it pricks you not so sore
As the young man with the flaxen beard did I think
What a devil about him here do you poor.
If ever I see any such, I pray God I sink.
The more you loke on him, ye worse like him you shall.
Come away, come away from him for very shame.
And in dede will you be gasyng on him styll?
If you repent not this, let me suffer blame.
O friend Prudence, doe you see yonder glass?
I will tell what therein I doe see:
I can not speak for sorrow, now out alas,
All men for sin by Gods sentence damned be.
The spirit of God speaks by king Solomon,
That no man on earth lives without sin.
Dauid saith there is none good, no not one,
No not a child that this day doth his life begin.
Now sin I see requires eternal damnation,
If a child be damned that is but a day old,
Alas, where then shall be my habitation?
Which hath done more sins than can be told.
 Yea woman, God doth not only prohibit the dede,
But he forbids the lust and concupiscence,
Therefore thy heart hath great occasion to blede,
For many lusts and deeds hath defiled thy cōscience.
Body of God, are you so mad him to believe▪
These things are written to make folks afraid,
Will ye to him or to me credence give?
Or to your friends, by whom you were never dismayed▪
And I put case that the words now were true,
He speaks of men, but no women at all,
Women have no souls, this saying is not new,
Men shall be damned, and not women which do fall.
 By this term man, truly in holy Scripture,
Is undertake both man, woman, and child in dede,
Yea as many of both kinds as be of mans nature,
Which proceed of Adam the first parents sede.
 By the Law comes the knowledge of sin,
Which knowledge truly here I represent,
Which fret and byte the conscience within,
Causing the same evermore to lament.
I am evermore before the conscience sight,
Showing before him his condemnation,
So that by the deeds of the law, or by his own might
He can not attain unto salvation.
Lo Mary, have ye not spoon a fair thread?
Here is a pocky knave, and an ill favoured,
The deulll is not so evil favoured I think in dede,
Corrupt, rotten, stinking, and ill savoured.
It is not possible truly to declare here,
The horrible, loathsome, and stinking vilitie,
Which before the eyes of God doth appear,
Committed by this wretched women's iniquity.
Now wo be to the time that ever I was borne,
I see that I am but a damned devil in hell,
I know that there with devils I shall be torn,
And punished with more pains than my tong can tell
O blessed Law show me some remedy,
The Prophet calls thee immaculate and pure,
Thou of thy self in many places doest testify,
That the keepers of thee are always safe and sure.
He that obserueth all things written in me,
Shall live in them, as Moyses doth express:
But never man yet in this world I did see,
Which did not the contents in me transgress.
It is beyond all mans possibility,
To observe any commandment in me required,
Thereby appears his weakness and fragility,
Happened through sin, that against God he cōspired.
The power of the law is mans sin to declare,
And to show his damnation for the same,
But to give salvation for the souls welfare,
The law doth no such promise any time proclaim.
If there be no more comfort in the law than this,
I wish that the law had never ben made:
In God I see is small mercy and Justice,
To entangle men, and snarl them in such a trade.
I can you thank for that Mary in dede:
Well spoken, an unjust God do you esteem.
Even from the heart that sentence did proceed,
Fear not, their unjust God do you blaspheme:
You see no remedy but utter damnation.
Follow my counsel, and put care away,
Take here your pleasure and consolation,
And make you merry in this world while you may.
Of one hell I would not have you twain to make:
Be sure of a heaven while you dwell here,
Refresh your self, and al pleasure doe you take,
Pluck up a lusty heart, and be of a good chere.
O this knowledge of sin is so in my sight,
That if I should dye truly I can not be merry.
We will rid the knave hence anon by this light.
Or else of his life I will soon make him weary.
 O sinner, from thy heart put that infidelity,
Which hath drowned thee already in the pit of hell,
Trust thou in Gods might and possibility,
Whereof neither angel nor man is able to tell.
 That thing in dede, which to man is impossible,
Is a small thing for God to bring to pass,
This mercy to all senses is comprehensible,
Which he will declare by his holy Mossies.
 That thing which I cā not do through my infirmity
God is able by his son to perform in time appointed,
All my contents be shadows of his majesty,
Whom now in this time God hath anointed.
 That Mossies alone only shall the law fulfil,
And his fulfilling shall be in such acceptance,
That God for his sake shall pardon mankyndes ill,
Accepting his offering for a full contentation.
 That Mossies is the stone spoken of before,
Which of vain builders should be refused,
Yet he shall be the corner stone of honour,
Which in the building of gods tēple shall be used.
And all that trust in him with true believe,
That he is very God and man, into this world sent,
God will all their sins for his sake forgive,
So that they can be contrite and repent.
I ever believed yet unto this day,
That God was able of nothing all things to make,
And as well I believe also that he may,
Forgive, and mercy upon sinners take,
But saying that he hath made a determination,
By a law that none shall be saved good or bad,
Then he that would look for any salvation,
Truly I take him ten times for worse than mad.
He that will not the keepers of the law save,
Which observe diligently his commandments,
Much less truly on them mercy he will have,
Which have contemned all his words &amp; judgements.
Well Mary, I have condemned thee unto hell fire,
Yet not so condemned thee, but if thou can believe
In that Mossies, which for thee doth enquire,
There is no doubt but thy sins he will forgive.
Thy sore is known, receive thy salve and medicine,
I have the sick to the leach, give good ear,
Hearken diligently unto his good discipline,
And he will heal thee, doe nothing fear.
Let me feel your pulses mistress Mary be you sick
By my troth in as good tēpre as any woman can be
Your veins are full of blood, lusty and quick,
In better taking truly I did you never see.
The body is whole, but sick is the conscience,
Which neither the law nor man is able to heal,
It is the word of God received with penitence,
Like as the book of wisdom doth plainly reveal.
Conscience? how doth thy conscience little Mall?
Was thy conscience sicked, alas little fool?
Hooreson fools, set not a pynne by them all,
Wise enough in dede, to follow their foolish school,
You bottle nosed knave, get you out of place,
Avoid stinking horizon, a poison take thee,
Hence, or by God I will lay thee on the face,
Take heed that hereafter I doo you not see.
Though I appear not to his carnal sight,
Yet by the means that she knows the law,
I shall trouble his always both day and night,
And upon his conscience continually gnaw.
What chere? now is here but we twain alone,
Be merry mistress Mary, and away the mare,
A murreyn go with them, now they be gone,
Pluck up your stomach, and put away all care.
O moister Prudence, my heart is sore vexed,
The knowledge of sin is before me always:
In my conscience I am so grievously perplexed,
That I wot not what to doe truly nor say.
Benedicite, art thou come with a vengeance▪
What wilt thou do? Mary, doe you love me?
My words print well in your remembrance,
To yonder fellows saying doe you never gre.
Into this world God hath sent his own,
Not to judge the world, or to take vengeance,
But to preach forgiveness and pardon,
Through true faith in him, and perfect repentance.
The son of man is come to seek and save,
Such persons as perish and go astray,
God hath promised them life eternally to have,
If they repent, and turn from their evil way,
The kingdom of heaven is at hand, therefore repent,
Amend your lives, and the Gospel believe,
The son of God into this world is sent,
To have mercy on men, and their sins to forgive.
O here is the Mossies, of whom we have harde,
What say you Prudence is not this same he?
A Mary, do you my words no more regard,
You have a wavering wit now well I doe see,
Is not this a like person, the son of God to be,
And the Mossies which the world should save?
He is a false harlot you may believe me,
Whom you shall see one day handled like a knave.
If the law of God published by Moyses,
Be not able to bring men to salvation,
Much less such a wretched man doubtless,
Can do ought for your souls consolation.
Tush take one heaven in this present world here,
You remember what before to you I have said:
Pluck up your heart wench, and be of good there,
Never regard his words, tush, be not afraid.
The law hath set my sins before my sight,
That I can not be merry, but am in despair:
I know that God is a Judge, equal and right,
And that his law is true, pure, clean and fair,
By this law am I condemned already to hell.
The words he hath spoken must be fulfilled:
Of mirth and joy it is but folly to tell,
For I perceive that both body and soul be spilled.
Like as the father raises the dead again,
And unto life doth them mercifully restore:
So the son quickened the dead it is plain,
And gives them a life to live evermore,
Verily verily I say, he that hears my voice,
And believes on him that hath me sent,
Shall have everlasting life therein to rejoice,
And shall not come into damnable torment.
But the same pass from death unto life,
Repent, and trust in Gods mercy for my sake.
With the sins of the world be at debate and strife,
And unto grace my heavenly father will you take.
All they whom the law condemns for sin,
By faith in me, I save and justify,
I am come sinners by repentance to win,
Like as the Prophet before did prophecy.
Thou woman, with mercy I do thee prevent,
If thou can in the Son of God believe,
And for thy former life be sorry and repent,
All thy sins and offences I doe forgive.
Who is the son of God sir, of whom do ye talk?
Which hath this power whereof you do boast,
It is best for you out of this country to walk,
And never more be scene after in this coast.
The son of God quote he? This is a pride in dede.
Trow thou that the father can suffer this?
They come of Abrahams stock and holy sede,
And thou says that they believe all amiss.
Avoid out of this woman thou Infidelity,
With the .vii. devils which have his possessed,
I banish you hence by the power of my divinity,
For to salvation I have his dressed.
O Iesus the Son of God ever living,
Why come thou before the time vs to torment?
In no person for thee we can have any abiding,
Out upon thee the son of God omnipotent.
Arise woman, and thank the father of heaven,
Which with his mercy hath thee prevented,
By his power I have rei•cted from the spirits seven,
Which with unbelief have thy soul tormented.
Blessed be thy name O father celestial,
Honour and glory be given to thee world without end,
O Lord, doest thou regard thus a womā terrestrial?
To thee what tong is able worthy thanks to repent?
O what a sinful wretch Lord have I been?
Have mercy on me Lord, for thy names sake,
So grievous a sinner before this day was never scene
Vouchsafe therefore compassion on me to take.
Can thou believe in God, the maker of all thing,
And in his only son, whom he hath sent?
I believe in one God, Lord and heavenly king,
And in thee his only son with hearty intent.
Good Lord I confess that thou art omnipotent,
Help my slender belief and infirmity:
My faith Lord is wavering and insufficient,
Strēgth it I pray the with the power of thy majesty.
No man can come to me, that is, in me believe,
Except my father draw him by his spirit.
Behold Faith and Repentance to thee here I give,
With all other virtues to thy health requisite.
Note well the power of Gods omnipotence:
That soul which of late was a place of devils,
He hath made a place for him self by his clemency,
Purging from thence the multitude of evils.
The mercy of Christ thought it not sufficient,
To forgive his sins, and devils to pourge,
But gives his grace to be penitent,
That is, his soul ever after this day to scourge.
The virtue of Repentance I do represent,
Which is a true turning of the whole life and state,
Unto the will of the lord God omnipotent,
Sorrowing for the sins past with displeasure &amp; hate.
That is to say, all the inward thoughts of the hart
And all the imaginations of the mind,
Which were occupied evil by Sedans art,
Must hence forth be turned after an other kind.
Dauid my father on his sins did always think,
Howe horrible they were in God almighties sight,
Tears were his sustenance, yea both meat &amp; drink,
His hole meditation was in heaven both day &amp; night
So that Repentance is described in Scripture,
To be a returning from syn with all the soul &amp; hart,
And all the life time in repenting to endure,
Declaring the same with the senes in every part.
As thus, like as the eyes have ben vainly spent
Upon worldly and carnal delectations,
So henceforth to weeping and tears must be bent,
And wholly given to godly contemplations.
Likewise as the ears have ben open always
To here the blaspheming of Gods holy name,
And filthy talking evermore night and day,
Now they must be turned away from the same.
And glad to hear the Gospel of salvation,
How God hath mercy on them that doe call,
And how he is full of pity and miseration:
Raising up such again as by sin did fall.
The tong which blasphemy hath spoken,
Yea and filthy, to the hurt of soul and body:
Whereby the precepts of God have ben broken,
Must hence forth praise God for his mercy daily.
Thus like as all the members in times past,
Have ben servants of unrighteousness and sin,
Now Repentance doth that service away cast,
And to mortify all his lusts doth begin.
True repentance never turns back again:
For he yt lays his hād on the plough, &amp; looks away,
Is not apt in the kingdom of heaven to reign,
Nor to be saved with my saints at the last day.
O Lord without thy grace I do here confess,
That I am able to do nothing at all,
Where it pleases thee my misery to redress,
Strength me now that hence forth I do not fall.
Grant me Lord such a perfect repentance,
And that I look no more back, but go forward still,
Put my misery evermore into my remembrance,
That I may forthinke my life that hath ben so ill.
The holy virtue of Faith I do represent,
Joined continually with repentance:
For where as the person for sin is penitent,
There I ascertain him of health and deliverance.
Wherefore I am a certain and sure confidence,
That God is merciful for Christ Iesus sake:
And where as is a turning or penitence,
To mercy he will the penitent take:
Faith therefore is the gift of God most excellent,
For it is a sure knowledge and cognition
Of the good will of God omnipotent,
Grounded in the word of Christ's erudition,
This faith is founded on Gods promission,
And most clearly to the mind of man revealed,
So that of Gods will he hath an intuition,
Which by the holy ghost to his heart is sealed.
This Faith with the word hath such propinquity,
That proprely the one is not without the other,
Faith must be tried with the word of verity,
As the child is by the father and mother.
Yea truly, if this faith do from Gods word decline,
It is no faith, but a certain incredulity,
Which causes the mind to wāder in strange doctrine
And so to fall at length into impiety.
The word to a glass compare we may,
For as it were therein, Faith God doth behold,
Whom as in a cloud we loke upon always,
As hereafter more plainly it shall be told.
My heart doth believe, and my mouth doth publish.
That my lord Iesus is the son of God eternal.
I believe that my soul shall never perysh,
But reign with him in his kingdom supernal.
The operation of Faith is not to enquire
What God is as touching his propre nature,
But how good he is to vs to know faith doth desire,
Which thing appears in his holy Scripture.
It is not enough to believe that God is true only,
Which can never lie, nor deceive, nor do ill:
But true faith is persuaded firmly and truly,
That in his word he hath declared his will.
And also what soever in that word is spoken,
Faith believes it as the most certain verity,
Which by his spirit he doth vouchsafe to open
To all such as seek him with all humility.
Christ the son of God here hath promised,
Forgiveness of sins to you sister Mary,
Of his own mercy this to do he hath devised,
And not of your merits, thus you see plainly.
If in this promise you be certain and without doubt.
Believing that the word of his mouth spoken
He is able, and also will do and bring about,
Then that you have Faith it is a token.
O Iesu, grant me this true faith and believe,
Lord I see in my self as yet imperfection:
Vouchsafe to me thy heavenly grace to give,
That it may be my governance and direction.
Mary my grace shall be for thee sufficient,
Go thy way forth with faith and repentance,
To hear the Gospel of health be thou diligent,
And the words thereof bear in thy remembrance.
Though in person we shall no more appear,
Yet invisibly in your heart we will remain.
The grace of God shall be with you both far &amp; ne'er,
Whereby from all wickedness I shall you detain.
Honour, praise, and glory to the father eternal,
Thanks to the son, very god and very man,
Blessed be the holy gost, with them both coequal,
One god, which hath saved me this day from Sathā
I thank thee O father, O lord of heuē, earth, &amp; of al
That thou hast hidden these things from the sapient,
And hast revealed them to the little ones and small,
Yea so it pleased thee O father omnipotent.
All things of my father are committed unto me,
And who the son is, none but the father doth knew
No mā but the son knows who ye father should be,
And he to whom the son will reveal and show.
Come unto me all you that with labour are op••essed,
And are heavy laden, and I will you comfort,
Despair not for that you have transgressed,
But for mercy do you boldly to me resort.
My yoke upon your necks do you gladly take,
And learn of me, for I am lowe and meke in hart,
And you shall find rest for your souls never to slake,
My yoke and burden is light in every part.
I came not into the world, the righteous to call,
But the sinful persons unto repentance:
The whoale have no need of the physician at all,
But the sick have need of deliverance.
Verily I say unto you, that the angels,
Have more joy in one sinner that doth repent,
Than in many righteous persons else,
Which are no sinners in their judgment.
God speed you sir heartily, and well to fare,
I rejoice much that I chance you here to find,
In good soth I was sorry, and toke much care
That I had no time to declare to you my mind.
We know that you do much good in the country here
Wherefore the living God is glorified:
You heal the sick persons both far and ne'er,
Like as it hath ben credibly testified:
My father even unto this time works truly,
And I work according to his commandment &amp; will,
The son can do nothing of him self duly,
But that he sees the father doing always still.
Whatsoever the Father doth, the son doth the same,
For the father doth the son entirely love,
And shows him al things to the praise of his name,
And shall show him greater works thā these as you shall prove
Lo sir, what need you have more testimony
You hear that he doth him self the son of God call,
Doth not the law condemn that blasphemy:
Commanding such to be slain great and small?
For a season it behooves vs to have patience,
I showed you the reason wherefore of late:
At this season I pray you do your diligence,
And semble rather to love him than to hate.
Shall it please you sir, this day to take payne
With me at my house to take some repast,
You shall be welcome doubtless I tell you plain,
No great puruiance for you I entend to make.
My meat is to doe his will that hath me sent,
But sir I thank you of your great courtesy,
To come to you I shall be very well content,
So that you will appoint the hour steadily.
All things be in manner ready I think verily,
In the mean season in my garden we will walk.
Take the pains to go with me, I pray you heartily,
Till dinner be ready, of matters we will talk.
With a good will I will waite upon you,
Pleases it you to go before, you know the way.
Sir•, you see how that we are appointed now,
Make all things ready without delay.
Sir I will go about as fast as I may,
In good faith I would that I might have my will:
I would prepare for him a gallows this day,
Upon the which I desire his blood to spill.
A vengeance take him thief, is he gone?
From Mary Magdalene he did me chase:
From Symon the Pharisie he will drive me anon,
So that no where I shall be able to show my face.
Nay, we are so surely fixed in the Pharisies mind,
That his blasphemous words can not drive vs thēce
Women's hearts turn oft as doth the wind,
And again of the law they know not the sense,
In malice I have made them all so blind,
That they judge nothing in Christ aright:
To the letter of the law so fast I do them bind,
That of the spirit they have no manner of light.
I will tell thee Malicious Judgment,
His words be of such strength and great power,
That the devil him self and all his rabblement,
He is able to expel, and utterly to devour.
Tush hyde thy self in a Pharisies gown,
Such a one as is bordered with the cōmaundemēts
And then thou moist dwell both in city and in town.
Being well accepted in all men's judgements.
As for a gown, I have one convenient,
And lo here is a cap agreing to the same.
As thou says, that gear is very ancient,
I warrant thee now to escape all blame,
Mary of one thing thou must take good heed,
As ne'er as thou can let him not behold thy face,
Doubt thou not, but he shall have his mede,
If I remain with the Jaws any space.
And as for the reverend bishop Cayphas,
With all the Aldermen of Jerusalem.
Will help to bring that matter to pass,
For I am like for ever to dwell with them.
The same Christ dines with Simon to day,
Who commanded to prepare the table in all hast,
Help to make all ready, and the cloth to lay,
For surely here he purposes to take his repast.
By God he shall have sour sauce it may hap,
Do thy part, and surely I purpose to watch,
It shall be hard, but we will take him in a trap,
He shall find him here that will him match.
Go and fetch trenchers, spoons, salt and bread,
See whether the cooks be ready also I pray thee.
They will come to dinner I dare lay my head,
Before that all things prepared well shall be.
A straw, all this gear will quickly be done,
The cooks be ready also I am sure.
Let me see, bier lady it is almost noon,
I marvel that they can so long fasting endure.
Yonder they come, turn thy face out of sight,
Thou must make courtesy down to the ground.
I would he were hanged by God and by this light.
For never before this day was I thus bound.
Sir now are you welcome, I pray you come ne'er,
Fetch in meat sirs, I pray you quickly.
I promise you I bid you for no good chere,
But such as it is, you are welcome heartily.
Pleases it you to wash sir, here is water,
Let not yonder beggarly fellow wash with you,
Can you not a while dissemble the matter?
It is no time to talk of such gear now.
Will you sit sir, bring hither a cushion and a stool.
Set it down I say there, there at the tables end.
Here is a business with a beggarly fool.
It grieves me the time about him to spend.
Go to, you are welcome hitherto my moister Simon
Think your self at home in your own place.
I thank you sir, I will sit down even anon,
But first we will praise God, and say our grace.
Blessed art thou heavenly father, which of thy mercy
Hast made man to thine own image and similitude
Which through Sedans wicked malice and envy
Was spoiled of thy grace and of ghostly fortitude.
But at this time of thy mercy appointed,
Thou hast looked on man, of thy compassion,
And sent thine own son with thy spirit anointed,
Which for his sin shall make satisfaction.
Let all creatures praise thee for their creation,
Glory to thy name for their preservation,
Laud and honour to thee for their restoration,
All thanks to thee for eternal salvation,
I pray you sit down, I pray you heartily,
You are welcome, I pray you eat such as is here,
Go to, I would not have you to make any courtesy,
I am sorry that for you I have no better chere.
It is simple chere as you say in dede,
It is to good for him by the Mass,
Haie is good enough for him thereon to feed,
Or for any such foolish ass.
Mark you not what in his grace he did say?
Thou hast sēt thy son anointed with the holy ghost
By these words evidently understand we may,
That to be the son of God of him self he doth boast.
Whereof doe you .ii. talk what is the matter,
Is there any thing that doth grutch your conscience?
This is the truth of our talk yea I will not flatter,
Your gest said a word whereof I wold have ītelligēce
He thanked God at this time now appointed,
That on men's sins he had pity and compassion,
And hath sent his son with his spirit anointed,
Which for his sin should make satisfaction.
Hath God into this world sent his own son?
Or who is the son of God I wold be glad to know
Like as now he speaks, so oft times he hath done,
The time and place I am able to show.
I pray you my guest his mind do you satisfy,
It is said, that the son of God you do your self call.
I am come into this world the truth to testify,
Whereof the scripture and the Prophets do witness all
If I of my self should bear testimony,
My witness of you should not be taken as true,
But there is an other that witnesses of me verily.
And I know that his testimony is true.
Of man truly no testimony do I take:
But I speak these words that saved you might be.
The son of God is sent hither for your sake,
Whom in the glory of his majesty you shall se.
The works which to me the father doth give,
That I may doe them, those works to you I say,
Bear witness, if you have the grace to believe,
That the father hath sent me into the world this day.
Besides these works, the father that hath me sent,
Hath by many scriptures of me testified:
By the which the matter is evident,
That my words spoken before are verified.
But the father you have never heard speaking,
And what he is by faith you have never scene:
His word you have not in you remaining.
Therefore to him whom he hath sēt faithful you have not bē
Search yt scriptures, for you thīk in your mind
That in them you shall obtain life eternal,
Them to bear witness of me you shall find,
How I am the son of the living God immortal.
Well sir, you are welcome, I wold not have you to thīk
That I did bid you hither to tempt or to prove,
But that I would have you both to eat and drink,
Even as my entire friend, and for very love.
Wherefore any thing that is here done or said,
Shall be laid under foot, and go no further,
For surely if your words should be betrayed,
As a blasphemer the people would you murder,
You know that there is .xi. hours in the day
And night comes not till the .xii. hours be expired
It is not in mans power my life to take away,
Till the hour comes of my father required.
Under the foot quote hee if I keep counsel,
I would I were hanged up by the very neck.
Fie on him horizon traitor and very rebel,
Hear you not how god him self he begins to check?
Though moister Symon doth but few words say
Yet I warrant you he bears this gear in mind,
Doubt thou not but he will find such way,
That he shall be rid and as many as be of his kind.
Go to I pray you, alack you eat no meat:
You see that at this time we have but plain fare.
When we have sufficient before vs to eat,
Let vs thank God, and put away all care.
The more that I accustom my self with repentance,
The more I see mine own sin and iniquity,
The more knowledge thereof, the more greuance,
To a soul that is converted from his impiety.
To all the world an example I may be,
In whom the mercy of Christ is declared,
O Lord, what goodness did thou in me see?
That thus mercifully thou hast me spared.
What goodness? nay rather what a rabble of evils,
Full of wickedness, like one past all grace,
Replenished with a multitude of devils,
Which as in hell in my soul had their place.
These were the merits and deeds that I had,
Only thy unspeakable mercy did me prevent:
And though that my life hath been so bad,
Yet thou wilt no more but that I should repent.
O who shall give me a fountain of tears,
That I may shed abundantly for my sin?
This voice of the Lord always soūdeth in mine ears
Repent, repent, and thou shalt be sure heaven to wyn
He saith also, do the fruits of Repentance.
O Lord, who is able those worthy fruits to do?
I am not able to doe sufficient penance,
Except thy grace good Lord, do help me thereto.
But like as the parts of my body in times past,
I have made servants to all kind of iniquity,
The same iniquity away for ever I do cast,
And will make my body servant to the verity.
This hair of my head which I have abused,
I repute vile and unworthy to wipe my lords fete,
No obsequy therewith of me shall be refused,
To do my Lord Iesus service, as it is most mete.
These fleshly eyes which with their wanton looks,
Many persons to sin and vice have procured.
They have ben the devils volumes and books,
Which from the service of God have other allured.
Now you sinful eyes shed out tears and water,
Wash the Lords fete with thē whō you have offended
To show such obsequy to him it is a small matter,
Which by his grace hath my sinful life amended.
O wretched eyes can you weep for a thing temporal,
As for the loss of worldly goods and parents,
And can you not weep for the lord celestial?
Which loss incomparably passes all detriments.
With this ointment most pure and precious,
I was wont to make this carcass pleasant and sweet
Whereby it was made more wicked and vicious,
And to all unthriftiness very apt and mete.
Now would I gladly this ointment bestow,
About the innocent feet of my saviour,
That by these penitent fruits my lord may know
That I am right sorry for my sinful behaviour.
All my worldly substance abused before,
And through unbelief of sin made instruments,
Now will I bestow them only to his honour,
In helping him, and for his sake other innocents.
I shall not cease to seek till my lord I have found,
He is in the house of Symon I heard say,
The house stands on yonder same ground:
It was told me that he dyneth there to day.
I was not ashamed to sin before the Lords sight
And shall I be ashamed before mā the same to cōfesse?
To my Lord Iesus, now forth will I go right,
Acknowledging to him my penitent heart doubtless
Lo sir, what a fellow this is, it doth appear,
If he were such a prophet, as of him self he doth say,
He would know what manner of woman this same is here.
A sinner she is, he can not say nay.
A sinner quote he? yea she is a wicked sinner in dede
This is she, from whom he did me expel,
Behold, how boldly after him she doth proceed,
A harlot she is truly I may tell you in counsel.
Yea and yet to touche him he doth her permit,
Which is against the law for persons defiled,
Ought not among the just to intromit,
But from their company should be exiled.
I pray you see, how busy about him she is,
She washes his feet with tears of his eyes,
Heigh, mary yonder is like to be nothing amiss.
Behold, she anointed him to drive away flies.
Trow you ye moister Symon thinks not somewhat?
Yes I hold you a groat, though he say nothing.
He is not content I warrant you that,
Which thing you may see by his looking.
Sirs, take away here, we will no more now,
This first: Are you in such things to be tought?
What mean you, whereabout do you look,
I marvel whereabout you do occupy your thought.
Simon, the truth is so, I have a thing in my mind
Which unto you I must needs express and say.
Moister, say what you will, words are but wind,
I will hear you truly, as patiently as I may.
There were two detters, whom I did well know,
Which were in debt to a lender that was thrifty:
The one five hundred pence truly did owe,
And the other ought not aboue fifty:
Neither of these debtors had wherewith to pay,
Wherefore the lender forgave both, as it did behove.
Now according to your judgment I pray you say,
Which of these detters ought the lender most love▪
Mary, he to whom most was forgiven I suppose,
In few words truly you have heard my sentence.
You have rightly judged, and to the purpose.
Absolving my question like a man of science,
See you this woman? I know that in your hertes
You condemn her as a sinner very vnmete
To enter among you, and to touche any parts,
Of my body, yea either head or feet:
Saying among your selves, if this were a Prophet,
He would know what manner a woman this is
Which thus comes in while we be at meat,
A sinner she is, and hath done greatly amiss.
I say unto you, that into this world▪ I am come
To call such great detters unto repentance,
The just, which in their cōceits owe but a small sūme
Have no need of their creditors deliverance.
What a thief is this? he judges our masters thought,
If we destroy him not, he will surely mar all.
I ever said that he was worse than nought,
But among vs purvey for him we shall.
Sir, you take upon you very presumptuously,
I have bidden you unto my house here of good will,
And you reason of matters here contemptuously:
But take your pleasure, it shall not greatly skill.
I say unto you, that for this cause was I borne,
To bear witness unto the verity,
I see who be hypocrites full of dissembling scorn,
And who be persons of faith and simplicity.
Where as you think you have done me pleasure,
In bidding me to eat and drink with you here,
Your intent was to show your riches and treasure,
And that your holiness might to me appear.
But this woman hath showed to me a little obsequy:
For these gestures which she shows to me,
Proceed from a true meaning heart verily,
As by her humility plainly you may see.
When I came into your house the truth to say,
You gave me no water to wash my feet withal,
This woman hath washed them here this day,
With the tears of her eyes which on them did fall,
With the hair of his head she hath wiped the same,
Thinking all other clothes thereto over vile,
Horrible in his fight is his sin and blame,
Thinking his self worthy of eternal exile.
You gave me no kiss as the manner of the country is
But this woman since the time that I came in,
Would not presume my head or mouth to kiss,
But my feet, lamenting in his heart for his syn.
My head you did not anoint with oil so sweet,
As men of this country do their guests use,
But with most precious balm she anointed my fete,
No cost about that ointment she doth refuse.
Blessed are they, as the Prophet doth say,
Whose sins are forgiven &amp; covered by Gods mercy,
Not by the deeds of the law as you think this day.
But of Gods good will, favour and grace freely.
At this women's sin you do greatly grutche,
As though your selves were just holy, and pure,
But many sins are forgiven his, because she loved much
And of the mercy of God she is sure.
He to whom but a little is remitted in dede,
Loves but a little, we se by experience:
All have sinned, and of Gods glory have need.
Therefore humble your selves with penitence.
I say to thee woman, thy sins are forgiven all,
God for my sake will not them to thee impute:
For strength to continue, to him do thou call,
And see that thanks thou do to him attribute.
The mercy of God is aboue all his works truly,
What is it that God is not able to bring to pass?
I thank thee Lord Iesu for thy great mercy,
Thou art the son of the living God, our Mossies.
Now say you by this, here is a greater matter yet,
He forgives sins, as one with God equal.
And he may perceive truly, that hath any wit,
That he is but a man wretched and mortal.
Woman I say, thy faith hath saved thee go in peace:
Now art thou pacified in thy conscience,
Through thy faith, I doe all thy sins release,
Assuring thee to have mercy for thy negligence.
O joyful tidings, O message most comfortable,
Let no sinner be he never in so great despair.
Though he were sinful and abominable,
Let him come, and he will make him fair.
Blessed be the Lord of such compassion and pity,
Praise we his name with glory and honour,
I shall declare his mercy in town and city.
Thanks be to thee my Lord now and evermore.
I see the words which I have heard, proved true.
Men say that you are new fangled, and frivolous,
Going about the law and our rulers to subdue,
Introducing sectes perilous and sedicious.
I can no longer contain, but must say my mind,
In dede it is so, for by his devilish erudition,
Which he sows among the people of our kind,
At length they will make a tumult and sedition.
Such blasphemy since the beginning was not heard,
That, a man shall call him self Gods natural son,
To condemn the law of God he is not afraid,
Despising all things that our fathers have done.
Pleases it you reverend father, to give me licence
To say my mind to this blasphemerand thief,
In few words you shall have my sentence:
Of all heretikes I judge him to be the chief.
Perceive you not how he doth begin?
He comes to none of the princes and governors,
But a sort of sinners he goes about to wyn:
As publicans, whores, harlots, and unjust occupiers.
Them he prefers before such men as you be,
Saying, that they before you shall be saved.
An honest man in his company you shall not see,
But even them, which have them selves ill behaved.
Much good doe it you, here is sauce for your meat.
Moister Simon, look upon this fellow in season,
For in continuance he will work such a feat,
That you shall not release with all your reason.
O Symon, put away that Malicious judgment,
Which in your heart you do stubbornly contain,
You shall not perceive Gods commandment,
As long as he in your conscience doth remain.
Lo sir now that God he hath blasphemed,
Now his law he doth contemn and despise,
The Justice thereof of him is nothing esteemed,
To destroy the same utterly he doth devise.
Think you vs ignorant of gods law and will,
Which upon our garments do them wear.
Who but we doe the law of God fulfil,
For his precepts with vs in all places we bear.
To fulfil the law requires Gods spirit,
For the law is holy, just, and spiritual,
Of love to be observed it is requisite,
And not of these obseruances external.
As long as you have this malicious judgment.
Accompanied with Infidelity,
I say you can not keep Gods commandment,
Though you show an outward sanctity.
Lo sir here he calls me Infidelity,
And you know that I am called Legal Justification
You hear that it was spoken by Gods majesty,
That a man shall live by the laws observation.
An honest guest, come out dog, yea mary,
Good manners thus to taunt a man at his table:
But with fools it is folly to vary,
His words be taken but as a tale or a fable.
Away with this gear, how long shall we sit here?
At once: We have somewhat else to do I think.
Thanks be to thee O Father, for this chere,
Thanks be to thee for our repast of meat &amp; drink.
Now sir, you shall licence me to depart,
And the heavenly Father might illumine your mind
Expelling this infidelity from your hart,
Which with Malicious iudgemēt kepeth you blind.
Fare ye well: for me you shall no counts render,
All shall be laid under the feet that is here spoken.
Though you forget it, yet we purpose to remember
You know the way, go I pray you, the door is open.
For Gods sake sir, you and such as you be,
Look upon this fellow by mine advise:
For what he goth about all you may see,
Yea you have had warning of him twice or thrice.
All the multitude begins after him to run,
You see him and know his doctrine and opinion,
If you suffer him till more people he hath won,
Strangers shall come and take our dominion.
Have you not heard his open blasphemy?
The son of God he presumes him self to name,
The Justice of the law he condemns utterly,
To suffer him to live will turn to your shame.
It shall behove you to dog him from place to place,
Note whether openly he teach such doctrine:
If he doe, accuse him before his face,
For I will cause the bishops him to examine.
And where as he wills you vs to expel,
Calling vs wicked nicknames at his pleasure,
He goes about to make you to rebel
Against God &amp; his laws, as he doth without measure
For my part I will watch him so narrowly,
That a word shall not scope me that doth sound
Against you the fathers, that live so holily,
But to accuse him for it a way shall be found.
Well the time of our evening service is at hand,
We must depart, the sacrifice to prepare.
If you depart, we may not here idle stand,
For to wait upon you at all times ready we are.
At my being here even now of late,
It pleased my Lord Iesus of his great mercy
To speak sentences here in my presence.
Of the which I have no perfect intelligence,
The first is: Many sins are forgiven his said he,
Because she hath loved much, meaning me,
I pray you most holy Justification,
Of this sentence to make a declaration.
A question right necessary to be moved,
For thereby many errors shall be reproved,
It were a great error for any man to believe
That your love did deserve that Christ should forgive
Your sins or trespasses, or any sin at all:
For so to believe is an error sanaticall.
And how can your love desire forgiveness of your i'll
Seeing that the law it is not able to fulfil?
The law thus commands as touching love:
Thou shalt love thy Lord God as it doth behove,
With al thy heart, with al thy soul, &amp; with al thy strēgth,
And thy neighbor as thy self. He saith also at length:
There was never man borne yet that was able,
To perform these precepts just, holy, and stable,
Save only Iesus Christ, that lamb most innocent
Which fulfilled the law for such as are penitent:
But love followed forgiveness of sins evermore,
As a fruit of faith, and goth not before,
In that parable which unto you he recited,
Wherein he declared your sins to be acquitted,
He called you a detter not able to pay.
Then your love paid not your dets perceive you may
The forgiveness of your sins you must refer,
Only to Christ's grace, then you shall not err.
Of this thing plain knowledge you may have
In these words go in peace thy faith doth thee save.
So by faith in Christ you have Justification
Frely of his grace, and beyond mans operation,
The which Justification here I do represent,
Which remain with all such as be penitent.
Here comes love a special fruit of Faith,
As touching this, hear mekely what he saith.
O how much am I unto Iesus Christ bound,
In whom so great mercy &amp; goodness I have found?
Not only my sinful life he hath renewed.
But also with many graces he has me endued,
I am named love, from true faith proceeding,
Where I am, there is no virtue noting,
Love coming of a conscience immaculate,
And of a faith not fained nor simulate,
Is the end of the law as Scripture doth say,
And unto eternal felicity the very path way:
This love grounded in Faith, as it is said,
Hath caused many evils in men to be laid.
For where as the love of God in any is perfect,
There in all good works is his whole delete.
This true love with Mary was present verily,
When to Christ she showed that obsequy,
But this love did proceed from believe,
When Christ of his mercy did his sins forgive,
Love deserved not forgiveness of sins in dede,
But as a fruit thereof truly it did succeed.
Of this matter we might tarry very long,
But then we should do our audience wrong,
Which gently hath heard vs here a long space,
Wherefore we will make an end now by Gods grace,
Praying God that all we example may take
Of Mary, our sinful lives to forsake:
And no more to look back, but to go forward still
Following Christ as she did and his holy will.
Such persons we introduce into presence,
To declare the conversion of his offence.
First, the law made a plain declaration,
That she was a child of eternal damnation:
By hearing of the law came knowledge of sin,
Then for to lament truly she did begin.
Nothing but desperation did in his remain,
Looking for none other comfort but for hell payne.
But Christ whose nature is mercy to have,
Came into this world sinners to save,
Which preached repentance sins to forgive,
To as many as in him faithfully did believe.
By the word came faith, Faith brought penitence,
But both the gift of Gods magnificence.
Thus by Faith only, Marie was justified,
Like as before it is plainly verified,
From thens came love, as a testification
Of Gods mercy and her justification.
Now God grant that we may go the same way,
That with joy we may rise at the last day,
To the salvation of soul and body evermore,
Through Christ our Lord, to whom be all honour.
