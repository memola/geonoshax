AS the worm which in the timber is bred,
The self same timber doth consume and eat:
And as the moth which is commonly fed,
In the cloth with her bred, and the same doth fret.
So many persons are a damage great,
To their own country, which hath them relieved,
And by them their own country oft times is gréeued.
¶So many cities and towns are defamed,
By reason that some inhabitants is ill:
So that for ones fact, the whole town is blamed,
Although the residue to good doe their will.
Yet the fact of this one, the others good name doth spill,
And thus a reproach to his own town engenders,
And the good name of the whole town he hindered.
¶To what end these words we have spoken,
In our matter shall be more plainly expressed,
Which the Tide tarries no man, to name hath token,
For that it is most agréeable and best.
Because that no man from his pleasure will rest,
But each man doth take the time of his gain,
Although the same be to others great payne.
¶For so gréedy is the person avaricious,
Whom Saint Austen doth well liken to hell,
For that they both are so much insacious,
That neither of them know when they are well.
And Ambrosius doth verify and tell,
How that covetous persons do lack that they have,
And therefore not satisfied till they are in grave.
¶But where such people are, small love there doth rest,
But gréedy desire supplies the place:
The simple ones commonly, by such are oppressed,
For they nothing way, any néedy mans case.
But with gréedy grype, their gain they embrace,
No kind of degrée that they will forbear,
Neither any time they will let slip or spare.
¶And although that here a Courtier is named,
Yet thereby is not meant the Courtier alone:
But all kinds of persons, who their suites have framed,
Or to any such gréedy guts, have made their moan.
Being driven to their shifts, to have ought by lone,
How gréedinesse at such times, doth get what he can,
And therefore still cries, Tide tarries no man.
¶Which proverb right well might be applied,
To a better sense then it is used:
There is time to ask grace, this may not be denied,
Of thy sinful life so greatly abused.
Let not that time then be refused,
For that tide most certain will tarry no man,
Thus taking the proverb, we rightly do scan.
¶Thus worshipful Audience, our Author desires,
That this his act you will not deprave:
But if any fault be, he humbly requires,
That due intelligence thereof he may have,
Committing himself to your discretions grave,
And thus his Prologue he rudely doth end,
For at hand to approach, the Players intend.
TO the Barge to,
Come they that will go,
Why sirs I say when:
It is high tide,
We may not abide,
Tide tarries no man.
If ye will not go,
Why then tell me so,
Or else come away straight:
If you come not soon,
You shall have no room.
for we have almost our frayte
There are Usurers great,
Who their brains doe beat,
In devising of guiles:
False dealers also,
A thousand and mo,
Which know store of wiles.
Crafty cutpurses,
Maidens mylchnurses,
Wives of the stamp:
Who love mo then one,
For lying alone,
Is ill for the cramp.
Husbands as good,
As wigges made of wood:
We have there also,
With servants so sure,
As packthred most pure,
Which men away throe.
There are such a sight,
I cannot resit,
The half that we have:
And I of this Barge,
Have the greatest charge,
Their lives for to save.
Courage contagious,
Or courage contrary,
That is my name:
To which that I will,
My mind to fulfil,
My manners I frame.
Courage contagious,
When I am outrageous,
In working of ill:
And Courage contrary,
When that I doe vary,
To compass my will.
For as in the Bée,
For certain we sée,
Swéete honey and sting:
So I in my mind,
The better to blind,
Two corages bring.
And as with the sour,
Each day and hour,
The Physician invented:
To mingle as méete,
Something that is swéete,
Which his patient contēteth.
Even so some while,
To colour my guile,
Do give courage to good:
For I by that mean,
Will convey very clean,
And not be understood.
Now sir to show,
Whether we do go,
Will doe very well,
We mean to prevail,
And therefore we sail,
To the Devil of hell.
And though it be far,
Yet welcome we are,
When thither we come:
No chere there is,
Whereof we shall miss,
But be sure of some.
I Courage do call,
Both great and small,
To the Barge of sin:
Where in they doe wallow,
Till hell doe them swallow,
That is all they do win.
When come ye away,
Thus still I doe say,
As load as I can:
Take time while time is,
Least that you doe miss,
Tide tarries no man.
With catching and snatching
Waking and watching,
Running and riding:
Let no time escape,
That for you doth make,
For Tide hath no biding.
But ebbing and flowing,
Coming and going,
It never doth rest:
Therefore when you may,
Make no delay,
For that is the best.
¶By the mass sirs so where he is.
¶I told thée that hear we should him not miss.
¶Good master Courage most heartily good even.
¶In faith my friends welcome, all thrée by saint Steven.
Iesus good Lord how doe ye fare?
Cover your heads, why are you bare?
And how sirs, now sirs, lead you your lives,
Which of all you thrée, now the best thrives?
¶Tush man none of vs can doe amiss,
For we doe always take time while time is.
And where ever we go like counsel we give,
Telling all men that here they shall not still live.
¶Therein hurtful Help, thou dost very well,
The Tide tarries no man, thou must always tell.
¶Indéede hurtful Help, that is my name,
But I would not that all men should know the same.
For I am a broker the truth is so,
Wherefore if men in me hurtfulnesse should know,
There are few or none that with me would deal,
Therefore this word hurtful I never reveal.
My name I say, plain Help to be,
Wherefore each man for help doth come unto me,
Good master Help, help to that or this,
And of good reward you shall not miss.
¶And as thou from Help, hurtful dost throw,
So painted, from Profit, I must forgo,
For if any man know me, for profit but painted,
Men will but little with me be acquainted.
My master who a good gentleman is,
Thinks me as profitable as he can wish.
So that plain Profit, be thinks my name,
And before his face, my deeds show the same.
¶Farewell my masters for I may hence walk,
For I sée you two will have all the talk.
¶What feigned Furtherance are you so coy,
Will you never leave the tricks of a boy,
Come again I say, least I doe you fet,
And say what thou wilt, here shall no man let.
¶Fet mée?
¶Yea fet thée.
¶Marry doe what thou dare.
¶That will I not spare.
¶Good sir hold your hand, and bear with his rudeness,
¶Nay I cannot nor will not suffer his Lewdness.
¶Tush a sigge for him, let him doe what he can.
¶Alas sir who are you, but a Merchants man,
Good sir what you are, we know right well,
Who is your master, and where you doe dwell,
You profess that your master you doe greatly further.
And yet for his goods, you would him gladly murder.
¶If so I doe wish, it is long of thée,
For thou thereunto baste encouraged mée.
¶What hushed I say, no more of these words,
For appeaching oft, the appeacher disturbs.
Be friends again as you were at the first,
Let each man say the best, and leave out the worst.
¶• for my part doe thereunto consent.
¶Then give me thy hand if thou be content.
Now are we friends, as at first we were,
Therefore straight way thy mind let vs here.
¶Truly I mean to doe even as doe the rest,
For in mine opinion that is the best,
And as hurting help, hath hurting forgone,
And painted profit, is profit alone,
So I feigned furtherance, henceforth doe mind,
To be furtherance plain, leaving feigned behind:
Other men's furtherance to séeke I will say,
Yet will I séeke mine own as much as I may.
¶Else werte thou unwise, yea and a very fool,
Thou learned none otherwise, I trow in my school.
I am a schoolmaster for you thrée most fit,
Who endued you with courage, instead of great wit.
¶To be our master wilt thou take in hand,
Why we are as good as thou, thou shalt understand.
¶Alas pore knaves, what could you thrée doe,
If you have not courage belonging thereto.
¶And what can courage doe without help,
As much as a Kitling or suckling whelp.
¶And by hurtful help, what am I the better,
Being help to a hurt, I am no great getter.
¶It is folly with thée thus to contend,
We are as good as thou, and so I doe end.
¶Since that by words I can no maystry have,
I would prove what my manhood will doe sir knave.
¶Why art thou blind, may thou not sée,
That again thee one, we are here thrée.
¶And what can thrée doe against one,
I having courage, and they having none.
Therefore courage will claw you or you go hence,
Now defend your selves I will sée your fence.
¶What Courage I say thy hand now stay.
¶Will you then consent to that which I say.
¶There is no remedy but we must consent,
Sometimes it is good a fools mind to content:
Therefore I am content to be thine inferior,
And I will from henceforth take thée for superior.
¶And so will the residue I trow also.
¶If you say I sir, we will not say no.
¶Well sirs, then I will show you my mind,
But fyrse I will describe you, each one in his kind.
Thou help art a broker, betwéene man and man.
Whereby much deceit thou uses now and than,
Profit is one, who by service in sight,
Doth cause his master to think him most right.
A profitable servant, he thinks him to be,
Because he is profitable, while he doth him see.
And feigned Furtherance, doth fain him to further,
His master and others, whom fain he would murder.
Thus in séeking wealth you all doe agrée,
And yet you profess others friends for to bée.
¶No quisque sapit, queen sibi non sapit,
This saying I red, when as I went to school,
One not wise for himself, is but a very fool.
¶By my troth, and of that opinion am I,
And in that opinion I mean for to dye.
¶Tush why spend you time in speaking of that,
While thereon you talk, in vain is your chat.
For who helps not himself, before any other,
I count him a fool, if he were my brother.
And as I count him, all people doe so,
Therefore cease this talk, and hence let vs go.
For some of vs may chance to meet with a chiding,
Because that so long from home we are biding.
¶By S. Anne I think therein thou say well,
For I know thereof I am like to here tell.
¶Why man a little while breaks no square.
¶Tush help hath excuse, to colour that care.
¶Yea but already we have tarried to long.
¶Why then ye were best go without a song.
¶Nay I will tarry to sing, though therefore I should dye.
¶My help to singing, I did never deny.
¶Why then sirs have at it coragiously.
First Courage causes minds of men,
to wish for good or ill:
And some by Courage now and then,
at Tiborne make their will.
Help, Profit, and Furtherance do fain,
Where Courage doth catch in any mans brain.
¶Then help in hope to have his pray,
full secretly doth wait:
And as the time doth serve always,
he throws forth his bait.
Help, Profit, &amp;c.
¶Profit prolonged not the time,
to please his painted mind:
He passes not though master pine,
so he his pleasure find.
Help, Profit. &amp;c.
¶And Furtherance, thou last of all,
he came into the rowte:
He weighs not his masters thrall,
nor séekes to help him out.
Help, Profit, &amp;c.
¶Now Courage farewell for we must be gone.
¶Nay sirs you two shall not go alone,
For I doe mean to bear you company,
And so shall we be even a whole trinity.
Therefore Courage adowe.
¶Sir here was a trinity in a witness,
A man might have shaped thrée knaves by their likeness.
A trinity much like to the trinity of late,
Where good wife Gull, brake her good mans pate.
In came her man to make up the number,
Who had his nose shod, with the steal of a scumber.
But in fine, these thrée began to agrée,
And knit them selves up in one trinity.
And after they loved like brother and brother,
For very love, they did kill one another.
And then they were buried, I doe well remember,
In Stawtons strewn hat, vij. mile from December.
Where they had not lain the space of a day,
But four of those thrée, were thence run away.
The Constable came, with a back on his bill,
And because they were gone, he did them kill.
I Courage so cleft their Cushions a sunder,
To sée how they bled, it made me to wonder.
I my self was smitten twice to the ground,
I was very sore hurt, but I had not a wound.
I buskeled my self as though fight I would,
And took me to my legs as fast as I could.
And so with much payne hither I did come,
But hushed sirs I say, no more words but mum.
¶Tush talk not of that, for in vain you doe prate,
For there are none but fools, that wealthiness doe hate.
¶What Gréedinesse I say, why what is the matter,
Master wealthiness I would say, whereon doe you clatter•
¶What old friend Courage, art thou so ne'er hand,
Marry I will show thée, how the matter doth stand.
As I walked along, through by the stréete,
By such ways as mine affairs did lie:
It was my chance with a preacher to méete,
Whose company to have I did not deny,
And as we two together did walk,
Amongst other communication we had,
The Preacher brake out with reprocheable talk:
Saying that we citizens were all to bad,
Some of vs he says are gréedy guts all:
And •uell members of a common wealth,
He says we care not whom we bring to thrall,
Neither have we regard unto our souls health,
His talk I confess my conscience did nip,
Wherefore no longer I would him abide,
But suddenly I gave him the slip,
And crossed the way to the other side.
So alone I let master Preacher walk,
And here by chance I stombled in.
¶And art thou so foolish for any such talk,
To cease or stay thy wealth for to win.
¶Serra, he cried out of excessive gain,
Saying when any of our wares have néede,
Then doe we hoist them up to their payne,
And commonly make them pay for their spéede.
¶I perceive that fellow was hot of the spirit,
He would not have you take time while time is,
If ye follow his council, he will beggar you quite,
But what answer did thou give him to this?
¶Why thou know my quality is such,
That by contrary talk, I use no man to blame,
For although often my doings they touch,
Yet my talk always to the time I frame.
When he said excessive gayners were ill,
I said for them it was a shame.
And in all things else, I pleased his will:
And so I feigned my self without blame.
¶Thou dost wisely therein, I commend thée therefore,
For what ever thou think, yet say as they doe,
So shalt thou have their favours evermore,
And that wa• no blame thou shalt come unto.
¶Yea but truly his words did my conscience prick,
Of me he did so unhappily guess,
I promise shée he touched me unto the quick,
For that in gaining I used excess.
My conscience doth tell me, I have done amiss,
And of long time I have gone astray,
And a thousand witnesses the conscience is,
As Salust in most plain words doth say.
¶Why do•tech patch, art thou so unwise,
To quail for the saying of such a knave,
Thou know all the world will thée despise,
And a begging thou may go, if that nought thou have.
And how shalt thou have ought,
If thy gain be not great?
Consider this well in thy mind,
Remember thy house, and thy wife that peat,
Must still be kept in their costly kind:
Therefore take the time, while the time doth serve,
Tide tarries no man, this thou dost know,
If thy goods decay, then may thou starve,
So doing thou séekest thine own overthrow.
¶In déede as thou say, it doth me behoove,
Not so rashly to lay my gaining aside,
Least so my self a fool I doe prove,
By shooting from my profit so wide:
I consider my wealth is now at good stay,
Which I would be loath should be impaired,
For once rich, and after in decay,
Is a miserable thing, as Hymns hath declared.
Therefore I mean thy council to take,
Least of that misery I know the smart,
Then is it to late any moan to make,
Or from such foolishness to revert.
Therefore Courage adieu unto thée,
For it behooves me hence to depart.
¶Adieu Wealthiness till again we see,
Adieu great gréedinesse with all my hart,
Hath not Courage contagious now showed his kind,
By encouraging Gréedinesse unto evil:
Which late was drawing to a better mind,
And now again doth follow the Devil.
¶Lo thée Neighbourhood, where Courage doth stand.
¶What no good Neighbourhood, give me thy hand.
¶Those two first syllables, might be put out,
And then thou hittest my name without doubt.
¶Why is not no good Neighbourhood thy name?
¶Put away no good, and sée how it will frame.
For if thou doe put away no good,
There rests no more but neighbourhood.
¶Then is it neighbourhood, neither good nor bad,
Nay though we leave the first, it is good the next we had.
For leaving out no, put good to the rest,
Then is it good neighbourhood, thus I think is best.
¶Nay I will have them both two left out,
Because of my name men should stand in doubt:
For if no good neighbourhood I be named,
Then of all men I shall be blamed.
And if that good, to neighbourhood I have,
Men will say I doe it praise to crave.
So I will leave out both no and good,
And will be indifferent sole Neighbourhood.
¶Then Neighbourhood be it, if so it shall be,
And neighbourhood, what is thine errand to me?
¶Sir my coming, is for occasions two,
The first is for your council, what were best to doe,
In a matter which I have lately begone,
If I shall procéede, or else leave it undone.
The second is, if I shall procéede,
That you will stand my friend if I néede.
¶Ass•re thy self thereof without doubt,
Therefore show me the matter thou goosed about.
¶I thank you sir even with all my heart,
And I trust also that Help will doe his part.
¶Doubt not but that I to thee will be cleaving,
Therefore procéede and show him thy meaning.
¶Then sir this is the matter, if it shall please you give ear,
I have a neighbour who dwells to me somewhat near.
Who hath a Tenement, commodious and feat,
To which Tenement I bear a love very great.
This man my neighbour as far as I can learn,
Hath in his Tenement but a short term,
Four or five years or there about,
Which term you know, will soon be worn out.
Now sir might I in reversion, a lease thereof have,
I would give the Landlord, even what he would crave.
¶And who is the Landlord, thereof can you tell?
¶Master Gréedinesse, a man whom you know right well,
He is one which never did money hate.
¶Why then speak in time, least thou be to late,
The Tide tarries no man the proverb hath said.
Therefore sée no time herein be delayed,
Master Help here shall be to thee a stay,
For with master gréedinesse, he bears great sway.
¶I will doe for him what lies in me.
¶And then to your pains I will gladly sée.
¶Doubt not then, but thou shalt have thy mind.
¶As you say, I wish that I may it find▪
But I doubt that of my purpose I shall miss,
By reason of one thing, and that is this:
My foresaid neighbour which now holds the same,
Hath been there a long dweller of good name and fame.
And well he is beloved both of young and old,
Wherefore not only the neighbours with him will hold▪
But also the Landlord, I am in great doubt,
Will be therefore unwilling to put him out,
And • but a stranger among them God wot.
¶Marry sir it is much the better for that,
For if thou werte more strange, and borne out of the land.
Thou shouldest sooner have it I dare take in hand,
For among vs now, such is our country zeal,
That we love best with strangers to deal.
To sell a lease dear, whosoever that will,
At the french, or dutch Church let him set up his bill.
And he shall have chapman, I warrant you good store,
Look what an English man bids, they will give as much more.
We brokers of strangers, well know the gain,
By them we have good rewards for our payne.
Therefore though thou be strange, the matter is not great,
For thy money is English, which must work the feat.
¶In déede my money as a neighbour will agrée,
With any man wheresoever it be.
And I my self would be a neighbour to,
And therefore the •ather I doe that I doe,
For if it were not to be a neighbour by them,
I wise I would not take a house so ny them.
¶I dare say each man would be glad at his heart,
To have all his neighbours such as thou art.
What matter is it, if thou thy self be sped,
Though thou take thy neighbours house over his head.
¶Tush that is no harm, but rather it is good,
For he doth it only for pure neighbourhood.
Sée yonder comes one, if thou can make him thy friend,
Then may thou shortly bring thy purpose to end.
¶Now Master Courage how doe you fare.
¶Even glad to sée that you so merry are:
Furtherance you must pleasure a friend of mine.
¶Thereto I am ready at each tide and time,
To doe for him what in me doth lye.
Therefore let me know your mind by and by.
¶Serra, of thy master a lease he would have,
And therein thy friendship it is, he doth crave.
¶Sir, if that herein my friend you will stand,
I will give you therefore even what you will demand.
¶Then Neighbourhood thou shalt shortly sée,
That I can doe somewhat betwéene my master and thée.
Thou coldest never speak better to spéede,
For of money now he stands in need.
To pay for a purchase of certain land,
Which néedes he must discharge out of hand.
Therefore this time for thée well doth fall,
If that thou have money to tempt him withal.
¶Tush man for money I will not spare,
¶Then néedest thou no whit for to care,
And if thou take payne now to walk home,
There shalt thou find him sitting alone.
¶Cocks passion man hye thée away,
Thou know the Tide for no man will stay.
¶Why sir but will you not walk with vs thither?
¶No, doe Help and you go before together,
And I warrant you I will not long be behind you,
For though I be absent, yet I will mind you.
¶Then sir adieu till we méete again,
Doubt not but I will consider your payne.
Come Help shall we go.
¶It is time I trow.
¶Ah sir this gear doth trimly fall out,
I know this lease, which he goes about:
Wherefore I will work so on both the sides,
That of both parties I will obtain bribes,
I will show the old Tenant how one goes about,
To take his house and to thrust him out.
Wherefore he will largely grease me in the hand,
Because his friend therein I shall stand.
The other here did promise me plain,
That he would reward me for my payne.
Therefore Courage farewell unto •hée,
For how this gear will frame, I will sée.
¶Farewell Furtherance, my gentle friend,
A man may séeke Hell, and such two not find.
I mean a friend, so worthy to trust,
And a neighbour, that is so honest and just.
Of honesty I trow, he is méetely well sped,
That will take his neighbours house over his head.
I think there is no man, within this place,
But he would gladly such neighbours embrace.
Where two such neighbours dye out of one town,
The Devil shall be sure, to have one black Gown.
As well he is worthy, if I might be judge,
For in their affairs, he daily doth trudge.
Good council he gives them, both morning and evening,
What means they shall work, to their neighbours grieving.
He teaches them how, to pill and to poule,
In hope after death, to have body and soul.
Tush what mean I thus, of soul for to speak,
In vain with such talk, my brains I doe break.
For soul there is none, when the body is dead,
In such kind of doctrine, my scholars I lead.
Therefore say I, take time, while time is,
For after this life, there is nothing but bliss.
There is no soul, any payne to abide,
The Teachers contrary, from truth are far wide.
¶Oh so my hart is filled with doubt,
Which way I may work, my worship to win:
Shall I leave of Courtiers, so jolly a rout,
And eke of Ladies a company so trim.
And shall I home to my cottage rude,
There to live like a country clown:
Truly I know not which way to conclude,
To get my self worship and renown.
To win worship I would be right glad,
Therefore (willing to win worship) is my name:
In the country there is none such to be had,
And the Court doth ask, great cost for the same.
So that what I shall doe, I know not yet,
I consider it is toward a good time:
Wherein triumphing is used, as is most fit,
And where Courtiers must show themselves, brave and sine.
But this I conclude, as forced I am,
The Court for to leave, and homeward to pack:
For where is the money? here is the man.
If man he may be, that money doth lack.
¶Sir are you so foolish, the Court for to leave?
When the time is, that worship you should win:
For in times of triumphing, we always perceive▪
The Courtiers worship, doth first begin.
Therefore do you from such foolishness stay,
And Fortune may chance, give you as you wish.
¶But the whéeles of Fortune, as Socrates doth say,
Are like the snares, wherewith men take fish.
And in an other place, Plautus doth show,
A saying in Latin, and that is this:
Festo die si quid prodigeris,
Profesto egere liceat nisi pepereris.
If on the Holiday, wasting thou doe use,
On the work day thou may beg, unless well thou get:
So in triumphing, like effect ensues,
That next after, waste, indigence is set.
¶Then Perianders words you account least,
Who unto honour, an incorager is:
Honour (says he) Immortalise est,
Now sir I pray you, how like you this?
¶Those words to be true, I must néedes confess,
For honour in déede, is an immortal fame:
And now is the time the same to possess,
But I have not wherewith to achieve the same.
For money is he that the man must deck,
And though I have attire both cos•lie and gay,
Yet unless it be new, I shall have but a ge•k,
Therefore much better for me be away.
¶Tush man for money be thou not sad,
You Courtiers I know have Jewels good store,
And in ••ey for Jewels will always be had,
Therefore for that matter care thou no more.
¶Yea but how it is had, I partly doe know,
And what excessive interrest is paid,
Therefore you may say the more i• my woe,
Would God that I had it never assay•e,
¶Well, what ever it cost, it must néedes be had,
Therefore withstand not thy fortunate chance,
For I will count thée fool, worse then mad,
If thou wilt not spend money, thy self to advance,
Now is the time of hap good or ill:
Venture it therefore while it is hot,
For the Tide will not tarry for any mans will,
Never shalt thou spéede, if now thou spéede not.
¶Truly this talk doth encorage me so much,
That to sée the Court again, I doe pretend,
But I pray thée doest thou know any such,
As use upon gages money to lend?
¶Why man for that matter you néede not to doubt,
Of such men there are ynow every where,
But sée how luckily it doth fall out.
Sée yonder two friends of mine doe appear.
There is a broker betwéene man and man,
When as any bargains they have in hand,
The other a Merchants man now and than,
In borrowing money, thy friends they may stand.
¶So are we in déede, and what of that?
Who is it that with by would any thing have?
¶Even I a Gentleman whom money doe lack,
And therein your friendship would gladly crave.
¶Therein we can help you if your pleasure it be,
And will do or else we were greatly to blame,
Provided always that to our pains you doe sée,
And also put in a good pawn for the same.
¶A pawn sufficient I will therefore lay,
And also your pains I will recompense well.
But I must néedes have it out of the way,
Although my Lands therefore I do sell.
¶You shall have it sir so soon as you will,
And therein you shall be friendly used,
For in friendly using this fellow hath skill,
Therefore his counsel must not be refused.
He is servant unto a Merchant man,
Who is partly ruled after his mind.
¶In déede as you say, help me he can,
I doubt not but his friendship I shall find.
Doubt you not sir, but in pleasuring me,
I will recompense your pains with the most.
¶What I can doe for you, soon you shall sée,
It is but folly thereof for to boast.
¶Well then it is time that hence we were packing▪
For fain an end thereof I would know.
¶Why sir no diligence in vs shall be lacking,
For we are ready, if that you be so.
¶Why then that we go I think it were best,
Think you your master is now at home?
¶Ye I know well at home he doth rest,
And I guess that now he is sitting alone,
Therefore no longer here let vs stay.
¶Then sir adieu for I will lead the way.
¶Now may you sée how Courage can work,
And how he can encorage, both to good and bad:
The Merchant is encouraged, in gréedinesse to lurk,
And the Courtier to win worship, by Courage is glad.
The one is good, no man will deny,
I mean courage to win worship and fame:
So that the other is ill, all men will say,
That is courage to gréedinesse, which gets ill name.
Thus may you sée Courage contagious,
And eake contrary, both in me do rest:
For I of kind, am always various,
And change, as to my mind séemeth best.
Betwéene man and wife, sometimes I doe show,
Both my kindness, when my pleasure it is:
The goodwife gives her husband a blow,
And he for reward, doth give her a kiss.
The goodwyfe by Courage, is hardy and stout,
The goodman contrary, is patient and méeke:
And suffered himself to be called lout,
Yea, and worse misused, thrice in a wéeke.
How say you good wives, is it not so?
I warrant you, not one that can say nay:
Whereby all men here, may right well know,
That all this is true which I doe say.
But yet Courage tells you not all that he knows,
For then he must tell, of each wife the name:
Which is no great matter, the best are but shrews,
But I will not say so, for fear I have blame.
¶Now Courage I say, what news in the cost?
What good tidings abroad, doest thou hear?
¶Why what doest thou hear? hye thée home in post,
For I sent home a Gentleman, to séeke for thée there.
¶And what is the matter that with me he would have?
¶He must borrow some money, his worship to save.
¶Tush then to tarry he will be glad,
If that he come any money to borrow.
¶Yea but take the time, while it is to be had,
And defer not thy profit, until to morrow.
This Gentleman is a Courtier brave,
And now in néede of money doth stand:
Therefore thine own asking, of him thou may have,
So that thou wilt pleasure him out of hand.
¶And is he a Courtier, and stands in néede,
This to my purpose, doth rightly fall:
For the néedy Courtiers, my confers do féede,
And I warrant thée, that pinch him I shall.
For since I know, his néede to be such,
That money he must néedes occupy:
I know I cannot ask him to much,
If I his mind will satisfy.
Therefore now Courage to thée adieu.
¶Nay soft sir yet one word with you.
You told me not yet how you did agrée,
With no good Neighbourhood, that good man grout.
¶Mary sir he hath gone thorough with mée,
And the old Tenant he will thrust out.
But I with that matter have nought to doe,
Let them two now for that agrée:
I know I should never have come unto,
So much as therefore he hath payed to mée.
Therefore I might be counted mad,
If I to his proffer would not have tended:
This profitable lesson which of thée I had,
The Tide tarries no Man, was not unremembered▪
¶God spéede sir, I pray you show me if you can,
Did you not master Wealthiness here about sée.
¶Cocks passion this is the Gentleman's man,
Which at home doth tar• for thée,
Sir Wealthiness is not hence far away.
¶I am hée sir, what would you of me require?
¶My master at home for your worship doth stay,
And to speak with you he doth greatly desire.
If it be your pleasure home to repair,
Or if ye will, he shall hither come,
Your maysterships pleasure therefore declare,
And I know incontinent it shall be done.
¶Nay I mean homeward to hye,
For that I suppose to be the best,
And by all the means that in me doth lye,
I will fulfil your masters request.
¶I trust also you will consider my payne,
Thereby I trust you shall not loose,
For perchance I may prefer your gain,
By mean which with my master I doe use.
¶As I find thée ready in furthering of me,
So doubt thou not but thou shalt find,
Me even as ready in pleasuring of thée,
A word is enough, thou know my mind,
Therefore hence let vs now take the way.
¶My master thinks vs long I dare say.
¶I warrant you I will not be long behind,
I know no cause why here I should stay,
A company of my scholars I know where to find,
Therefore toward th•m I will take the way.
¶Whether shall I go, or which way shall I take,
To find a Christian constant and just,
Each man himself a Christian would make.
Yet few or none, that a man may trust.
But for the most part feigned, inclined to lust.
As to insatiable couetousenesse, most abominable,
Or some other vice, most vile and detestable.
It is well known, what rigour doth reign,
In that cruel tiger, my Landlord Gréedinesse:
Who in my house, would not let me remain,
But hath thrust me out, with spiteful spéedinesse.
Having no respect, to my naked néedinesse,
But altogether, regarding his gain,
Hath bereaved my living from me, to my payne.
What neighbourhood is, may also be séene,
My neighbour supposed, is my deadly foe:
What cruel chance, like to mine hath béene,
Both my house and living, I must now forgo.
What neighbour is he, that hath served me so?
Thus crewelly to take my house, over my head,
Wherein these forty years, I have been harboured and 〈◊〉
And now being aged, must thus be thrust out,
With mine impotent wife, charge, and family:
Now how I shall live, I stand in great dout,
Leading and ending, my life in misery.
But better doe so, then as they live, by thée very,
Catching and snatching, all that ever they can,
Because that (say they) Tide tarries no Man.
But God grant that they, in following that Tide,
Loose not the tide of Gods mercy and grace:
I doubt that from them, away it will slyde,
If they still pursue the contrary race.
As daily they doe, Gods laws to deface,
To their own souls hurt, and to their neighbours damage.
Still following the instructions, of cursed Courage.
I sée whom I séeke, is not here to be found,
I mean Christianity, constant and just:
I doubt that in bondage he lies fast bound,
Or else he is dead, and lies buried in dust.
But if he be living, to find him I trust,
Therefore till I find him, I will no where stay,
Neither in seeking of him, I will make delay.
¶Ah syrra, I cannot choose but rejoice,
When I remember my little pretty boys,
My scholars I mean, who all with •no voice,
Cry we love Courage, without other choice.
The young ymphes I incorage and lead,
In riotous footsteps, so trimly to tread.
That guilty, and unguilty, often they plead,
And being found guilty, hang all save the head.
The virgins which are but tender of age,
Rather then their trim attire should swag.
Their fails for new they will lay to gage,
To every slave, peasant, and page.
The grand signyoures, which in years are ripe,
With covetous claws, like the gréedy grype.
Their pore brethren, from their livings do wipe,
And evermore dance, after Corages pipe.
Courage never in quiet dothlye,
But the Tide faryeth no man, still he doht cry.
Therefore work thy will by and by,
That rich thou may be, when ever thou die.
¶Of all misfortunes, mine is the worst,
Truly I think I was accursed:
When I was an infant, not fully nursed,
Alas for grief, my heart it will burst.
I daily sée women as young as I,
Which in white Caps, our door doe go by:
I am as able as they, with a man to lye,
Yet my mother doth still, my wedding deny.
She says for wedding, that I am unfit,
Maids of fowertéene years she says, hath no wit•
And so every day she says I shall tarry yet,
That would God I were put quick in the pit.
God wot we maids, abide much misery,
And always kept in, from having liberty:
Of evil tongues we walk in ieoberty,
Most people are now so full of jealousy:
If a young man a maid doe but kiss,
Now (say the people) you may sée what she is:
Where if I were a wife, nothing I should miss.
But live like a Lady, in all joyful bliss.
I right well doe know, the peoples spite,
Because that to be pleasant, I have delight:
Therefore past grace, they say I am quite,
And a wilful wanton, my name they doe wright.
Yet I trust in God, once to sée the day,
That to recompense their spite I may:
For if ever I be married, and bear any sway,
Then I know what I have to say.
Therefore good God, make me shortly a wife,
Or else shortly take away my life.
¶Alas pretty Parnell, you may soon end this strife,
Young men fit for husbands, in this town are rife.
And your mothers ill will, you may soon prevent,
If you will follow my council, and intent.
¶Oh but if my mother would thereto consent,
To be married this night, I could be content.
¶But consent she or not, yet is it for thee,
Unto thine own preforment to sée.
Doest thou with any young man so agré•,
That he would consent, thy husband to bée.
¶Divers there are, who gladly would have me,
And being their wife, would trimly bebraue me.
From all wrong they would defend and save me,
Tush ynowe there are, which to wife doe crave me.
¶Then defer no time if that thou be wise,
For now to preferment, thou art like to arise.
The Tide tarries no man, else the proverb lies,
In delaying comes harms, thou séeest with thine eyes.
But by marriage all thy gréefe shall be eased,
And thy joys shall manifold ways be increased.
¶But alas my mother will so be displeased,
That I know her wrath will never be appeased.
¶And wilt thou for displeasing of her,
Thine own preferment and fortune defer?
Now art thou youthful, thy self to prefere,
And thy youthful beauty, men's hearts may stere.
But youthful beauty will not always last,
The Tide tarries no man, but soon it is past.
Therefore to wedding, see thou make haste,
For now much time thou doest loose in waste.
¶Oh what comfortable words are these,
Truly your talk doth me greatly please,
I will not stin•e but séeke out always,
Until that I have found some ease.
I care not what my mother doe say,
This matter I will no longer delay.
But a husband I will have out of the way,
And then may I boldly •ally and play.
No man dare me then once to control,
Least my husband chance for to scoule.
If any man use to entreat me foul,
My husband will lay him over the noule.
It doth me good to think of the bliss,
Which betwéene new married couples is.
To sée their dalliance sometime iwis,
It sets my téeth an edge by gisse.
Truly I would gladly give my best frock,
And all things else unto my smock.
To be married in the morning by vj. of the clock,
I beshrew my heart if that I doe mock.
Sir you will not beléeue how I long,
To be one of the wedded throng.
My thinks it lies in no tongue,
To show the joys that is them among.
¶It passes joy which they embrace,
They take their pleasure in every place.
Like Angels they doe run their race,
In passing bliss, and great solace.
¶Well sir I will no longer tarry,
But some man out of hand will marry.
Although from my mothers mind I varry,
Yet your words in mind I carry.
Therefore good sir to you adieu,
Until again I méete with you.
If I spéede well, a good coat new,
To your part may chance ensue.
¶Alas wilful wanton, my pretty peat,
My words have set her in such a heate.
Now toward wedding her love is so great,
That scarce she can neither drink nor eat.
Now I Courage in her doe begin,
So that for her mother she cares not a pin.
Now all her mind is a husband to win,
To be unwedded she thinks it sin.
How say you my virgins every one.
Is it not a sin to lye alone?
When .xij. years of age is gone,
I dare say you think so every one.
¶Nay now let him shift for himself if he will,
Since I am payed the thing I did séeke:
Alas good Gentleman, he is served but ill,
In faith he is in now by the wéeke.
He hath nought but that, for which he hath payed,
The lone of his money he hath dearly bought,
I warrant you it might be boldly said,
His cards being told, he hath won right nought.
¶And how so Help? is he so pinched I say?
By my troth that is a sport for to hear.
¶Serra, he stands bound forty pounds to pay,
But little more then thirty away he did bear,
For what with the merchants duty for lone,
Item for writing unto the scribe:
The third part into my pouch is gone,
And the merchants man, hath not lost his bribe.
So that amongst vs four, almost ten pounds,
Is clearly dispersed and spent:
The Gentleman swears, heart, blood, and wounds,
Repenting that after thy council he went.
¶Yea but sirs, my part is the least,
Who am the Captain of all the route.
¶Tush man for that matter, set thy heart at rest,
For that which we have, thou shalt not be without,
But syrra, see thou not who doth yonder appear,
By my troth me thinks two knaves they are.
¶Indéede whosoever unto thée is near,
For a knave he néedeth not to séeke far.
¶Sirs I will tell troth to make you agrée,
By guess I think, you are Knaves all thrée.
¶In déede thrée we are, we are no less,
And you are the fourth to make up the mess.
¶Well for that matter, we will not greatly strive,
But sirs what wind now did you hither drive?
¶I faith to show thée what luck we have had,
By (Willing to win Worship) that lusty lad.
To make talk thereof, now it is no time,
But if thou wilt go with vs, we will give thée the wine.
¶And as my master pleased you two, and the scribe,
So of Gréedinesse the Merchant, I had a bribe.
So that none of vs went vacant away,
But of one of the parties, had honestly our pay.
¶Yea but of them both, I had my bribes,
My masters, the Broker can play of both sides.
He is almost paid as well for his trotting.
As is the Scribe, for his writing or blotting.
Yea and yet both parties are not content,
For I dare say the gentleman, his bargain doth repent.
¶Marry sir can you blame him, that so hath been rung,
He may say he hath paid, to hear a fair tongue.
And now without his man he is gone,
His man gives him leave for to walk alone.
¶Let me alone, I warrant thée some excuse I will have,
And the worst fall I know, I shall be but called knave.
But yet sirs after him, I will hye,
And by the way I will invent some lye.
¶Nay soft Profit, you must not go so,
You must help to sing a part or you go.
¶So it be short, I am well content.
¶And all the residue thereto do consent.
WE have great gain, with little payne,
And lightly spend it to:
We doe not toil, nor yet we moil,
As other pore folks do.
We are winners all thrée,
And so will we bée,
Where ever that we come a:
For we know how,
To bend and bow,
And what is to be done a.
¶To knéele and crouch, to fill the pouch,
We are full glad and fain:
We ever still, even at our will,
Are getters of great gain.
We are winners. &amp;c.
¶It is our will, to poule and pill,
All such as doe vs trust:
We bear in hand, good friends to stand,
Though we be most unjust.
We be winners. &amp;c.
¶Full far abouts, we know the routes,
Of them that riches had:
Whom through deceit, as fish t• bait,
We made their thrift forth gad.
We are winners. &amp;c.
¶Now Cole profit, in faith gramercy for thy song.
¶Much good do it thée, but I am afraid I tarry to long.
Therefore friends adieu, for I will be gone.
¶Nay soft Profit, leave vs not behind,
For hence to depart, we also do mind.
¶Then thrée knaves on a cluster, get you together,
Néedes knaves you must go, for so you came hither.
¶But here we found thée, a Knave most of all,
And so we leave thée, as thou doest vs call.
¶Now so is the purpose, and this is the case,
Good cousin Cutpurse, if you be in place.
I beséech you now, your business to ply,
I warrant thée I, no man shall thée espy.
If they doe, it is but an hours hanging,
But such a purse thou may catch, worth a years spending.
I warrant thée encouraging thou shalt not lack,
Come hither, let me clap thée on the back.
And if thou wilt now follow my request,
At Tyborne I may chance clap thée on the breast.
So that of clapping, thou shalt have store,
Here clapping behind, and at Tyborne before.
But cousin Cutpurse, if ought thou do get,
I pray thée let me have part of thy cheat.
I mean not of thy hanging fare,
But of thy purse, and filched share.
Well sirs it is time, that hence I doe pack me,
For I am afraid, that some men doe lack me.
For some are perhaps, about some good déede,
And for lack of courage, they dare not procéede.
¶As with the poison, which is most delectable,
The heart of man, is soonest infected:
So the foe most hurts, who séemeth most amiable,
And of all wise men, is to be detected.
At this time this saying I have elected,
For that they which friendship, to me professed,
In stead thereof, my hurt have addressed.
They promised me, my friends for to stand,
And to help me to that which I did crave:
Until that I had obligated my land,
And then was I subject to every knave.
Each man then a portion would have,
The Merchant for lone, the Broker for his payne,
And the scribe for writing, each man had a gain.
Ninubula pluuia imbrem parit,
A mizeling shower engenders great wet,
Which saying officium prouerbia non tarit,
Many a little makes a great.
So every of them, by me wrought his feat,
And every of these bribes, being cast to account,
To a good portion I féele do amount.
But what villainy is there in such,
Who knowing a man, of their help to have néede▪
Will incroch upon him, so unreasonable much,
Their own gréedy desires to féede.
In•anal I remember, doth teach them in déede,
Whose words are these, both open and plain,
The vicious man only, séeketh his own gain:
Yea twice vicious, may they be named,
Who doe avarice so much embrace:
But what is their answer, when they are blamed▪
Say they, we have here but a little space.
Therefore we have néede to be getting a pace,
Wherefore should we gaining lay away,
The Tide tarries no Man, this is all they can say.
¶And as soon as she had supped up the broth,
The ladle she laid upon his face:
Woman quoth he, why art thou so wroth?
Knave quoth she, get thée out of this place.
¶Why friend, art thou not well in thy wit,
Wherefore smitest thou me in such sort?
¶Iesus Gentleman, are you here yet,
I thought long or this you had been at the Court.
Therefore you must pardon mine offence,
For I little thought it had been you.
¶Thy company is so good, I will get me hence,
Therefore cursed Courage adieu.
¶And in faith will you néedes begone,
What man you might tarry a while.
¶In thy company I have tarried to long,
For I perceive thou art full of guile.
¶Farewell frost, will you néedes be gone,
Adieu since that you will néedes away:
In faith this sport is trimsy alone,
That I can thus, a gentlemán fray.
¶Oh Help, might I once sée that day,
Tush I would not care, who I did wrong.
¶Doubt not, you néede not that for to fray.
You shall sée that day, or that it be long.
¶What day is that, wh•roof you doe speak•
May not a body your council know.
¶Mary sir, this day whereof we doe entreat,
Is a day of some notable show.
When the Courtiers in their bravery shall be,
Before their Prince, some show to make:
If such a day, Wealthiness might sée,
He hops then, some money to take.
For without cost, they may not be brave,
And many lack money, as he doth suppose:
Wherefore at some, a good hand he would have,
I warrant thée, by none he hops to lose.
¶Tush man doubt not, such days there will come,
That matter thou néedest not to fear.
¶To here of such 〈◊〉 I would •yde and run,
So glad I would be▪ of such days to hear.
Oh with these Courtiers, I love to deal well,
Or with other young Gentlemen, who have pounds or lands▪
For whether I doe lend them, or my wares to them sell.
I am sure to win largely, at their hands.
And specially, where in néede they doe stand,
Then in faith I doe pinch them home:
When I sée they must néedes have money out of hand,
And that other shift, to work they have none.
¶Why that is the way sir to come aloft,
Great wealth thereby, I know you doe get.
¶I warrant thée no time, I drive of,
Neither for any mans saying, the same will I let.
Well sirs I must now leave of this talk,
And I must bid you both twain adieu.
¶Soft master Gréedinesse whether do you walk,
What sir I pray you, one word with you.
¶Towards Powles Cross, from hence I doe go,
Perchance some profit there I may meet.
¶To Powles Cross, what there will you doe,
Do you the Preachers words so well like.
¶Tush for the preaching I pass not a pin,
It is not the matter wherefore I do go:
For that goes out whereas it comes in,
But herein my meaning, to thée I will show.
You know that many thither doe come,
Wherefore perchance, such may be my hap:
Of my ill debtors there to spy some,
Whom without delay, by the héeles I will •lap.
¶Why sir, and will you arest them there?
While they at sermon preaching be.
¶Will I quoth you, wherefore should I fear,
It is best taking them, while I may them sée.
¶Yea bear Lady sir, full wisely you say,
Take them while you may them get:
Or else perchance it will be many a day,
Or on them again your eye you shall set.
¶I remember what you have said,
Tide tarries no man, mark you that:
Wherefore no time herein shall be delayed,
Therefore sirs adieu to long I do chat.
¶Now that here is none but you and I,
I pray thée deliver to me my part,
Dispatch and give me it by and by:
And that I say with a willing hart.
¶I know no part I have of thine,
Therefore of me thou get no part.
¶I will make thée confess a part of mine,
Or else I will make thy bones to smart.
¶When the residue doe thereto agrée,
Then will I also give thée a part:
But if they no part will give unto thée,
If I give thée any, beshrew my heart.
¶Yea friend Help, are you at that point,
I will make you otherwise to say:
Or else I will heate you in every joint,
Now master Help, how like you this play.
¶What hold thy hand man, art thou so mad,
¶To confess me a part, I will make thée glad.
¶A part thou shalt have, when home we doe come.
¶Upon that condition mine anger is done.
A syrra think you, to make me your knave,
And yet all the profit your selves you would have.
¶What joy is like the linked life?
What hope might hold me from my wife?
Can man his tongue so frame,
Or eke dispose me from my dame?
What doth my substance good to mée,
I will therefore be frank and frée.
Where couples young do méete,
That pliant péece so swéete.
My joy for to declare,
Whose beauty is so rare.
In confers locked to lye,
To serve my wife and I.
¶Then doe you wisely, I swear by S. Anne
Take time while time is, for time will away:
The niggard is never counted a man.
Therefore remember to doe as you say.
¶I warrant thée, what I have said,
Nothing I mean shall be delayed.
I will the same fulfil,
To ease and please my will.
¶Truly sir you doe wisely therein,
For what good of hoording ensues:
Undoubtedly I think it a sin,
And beasts they are, which the same doe use.
¶Use it who list, for me he shall, I mean to hoard no store,
I mean to serve my time withal, and then I séeke no more.
¶Iesus husband what doe you mean,
To run abroad, and leave me at home:
You are such a man, as I have not séene,
I sée well, hereafter you will leave me alone.
That so soon begin, from me to be straying,
What man, it is yet but honey moon.
¶What woman would you have me always playing?
So may we shortly both be undone.
As for pleasure there is a time,
So for profit there is the like:
Therefore I pray thée gentle wife mine,
Be contented that my profit I seek.
¶Yea but husband I say consider in your mind,
That now we are young, and pliant to play:
But age approaching, makes vs lame and blind,
And lusty courage doth then draw away.
Then what may substance vs avail,
For age no pleasure doth regard:
Therefore good sweet heart doe not quail,
Think never that the world is hard.
¶Undoubtedly most true it is.
The woman herein doth truly say:
Sir have not you heard before this,
Tide tarries no man, but will away.
¶But better it is hardly to begin,
And after in better estate to bée:
Then first to be aloft full trim,
And after to fall to lower degrée.
¶Truly that is but a foolish toy,
At the first to live hardly and bare:
Many we sée miss that hoped joy,
And then it proves, for others they spare.
Have not many had, full sorrowful hearts,
By losing of that which they did spare:
Had they not better have taken their parts,
Then so for others, them selves to make bare.
And what know we, if we shall live,
To take our parts of that we scrape:
Would it not then your heart gréeue,
To leave your substance in such rate.
¶Yea but swéete heart, if nought we shall have,
When hereafter we shall aged war:
Then had we better wish vs in grave,
Then néedy poverty should vs vex.
¶Doubt you that such chance shall befall,
Truly you are greatly unwise:
We are able to kéepe vs from such thrall,
Spend, and God will send, else the proverb lye•,
¶His sending woman, we daily do sée,
Is a staff and a wallet unto such:
Who such excessive spenders bée,
Experience thereof we have to much.
¶Well husband this talk is in vain,
Therefore cease so sharply to speak:
For unless such talk you doe refrain,
I fear for unkindness my heart will break.
I little thought that you would thus,
Have now restrained me of my will:
But now right well I may discuss,
That you doe love some other gill.
¶Why woman doest thou think that I,
Have thought all this while, as I have said:
I did it only thy mind to try,
For pleasure in me, shall not be delayed.
While the time is, the time I will take,
What soever I list to say:
Of my goods no God I will make,
Therefore good wife, do thy sorrow away.
¶A faith are you such a one indéede,
By gisse you made me almost afraid:
My heart in my belly was ready to bléede,
When such foolish words in you I heard.
¶I would have counted him greatly unwise,
If he were so foolish, as himself he made:
Fools they are, which such pleasure despise,
But I knew that therein he would not wade.
And truly I am right glad to sée,
That so good an agreement betwéene you is:
For truly where couples doe so well agrée,
It may not be chosen, but there is great bliss.
I am sorry that thus we must part you fro,
Courage it is time for vs to depart.
¶But yet my friends before that you go,
Of a song help vs to sing a part.
By my troth husband we must néedes have a song,
Will you not help to further the same?
¶Yes by my troth, so it be not long,
Or else you might count me greatly to blame.
¶And I am con•ent a part for to bear.
¶Then be sure I will help in with a share.
THough Wistfulness and wantonness,
Some men have vs two named:
Yet pleasantness and plyauntnesse,
Our names we have now framed.
For as I one is pleasant, to kiss and to cully,
The other is pliant as ever was holly.
As youth would it have,
So will we be brave.
¶To live in bliss, we will not miss,
What care we for men's •ayings:
What joy is this, to sport and kiss,
But hurt comes in delayings.
The one is full ready to the others becking,
Betwéene vs there is neither chiding, nor checking.
As youth will it have, &amp;c.
¶Full brave and full fine, we pass the time,
Take time while time is biding:
What joy is thine, the same is mine,
My mind shall not be sliding.
Our goods are our own, why should we spare,
Or for time to come, why should we care.
As youth would it have. &amp;c.
¶Now friends adieu for we must depart,
¶Farewell my gentle friends withal my hart.
¶Well husband now I will home repair,
To sée that your dinner dressed be.
¶Doe so wife, and sée we have good fare,
I mean not long to tarry after thée.
Whose joy may be compared to mine,
I have a wife beautiful and gay:
She is young, pleasant, proper and fine,
And pliant to please me both night and day.
For whom should I pinch, for whom should I spare,
Why should I not be liberal and frée,
How ever the world go I doe not care.
I have enough for my wife and me,
And if my substance chance to decay:
I know my credit is not so ill,
But that I can borrow twenty pound always.
To serve me at my pleasure and will,
For repayment thereof, no care I will take:
No matter it is if the same I may get,
While it lasts, therewith I will merry make.
What skils it though that I come in debt.
While young I am, youthful I will be,
And pass my time in youthful sort:
For as my wife here said unto me.
Age doth delight in no pleasant sport,
Wherefore since pleasure I doe love:
In youth it behooves to take the same,
Nothing there from my heart shall move.
But I thereto my heart will frame.
I fear me that I tarry to long,
My wife doe look for me before this:
Therefore homeward I will be gone,
For there is joy and heavenly bliss.
¶What infidelity in him doth rest,
Who no time forbears to take his pray:
Most like the gréedy or savage beast,
Who in creuelty rages both night and day.
Might he not the space of one Sermon stay,
What care or mind gave he to Gods word,
Who at preaching thereof did me so disturb.
Is the Sabboth day, and Paules Cross,
A time and place to vex thy debtor?
Or hast thou Greediness by me had any loss?
Nay by me thou art a hundred pound the better,
I speak of the least and not of the greater.
Yet I never denied, my debt for to pay,
But in déede I required a longer day.
¶Tush sir this talk is all but in vain,
Mean you thus the time to delay?
Dispatch therefore, and please me for my payne▪
And toward the Counter, let vs away.
¶No haste but good, stay yet a while,
Or else take the payne with me for to walk:
About the quantity of half a mile,
With a friend of mine, that I might talk.
¶For a Royal I will not so far go▪
Therefore set your heart at quiet.
¶I mean to please no Sergeant so,
I am no customer for your diet.
But since to go, you doe not intend,
You must take pains here to tarry with me:
Until for a friend of mine I doe send,
Which I trust shortly my bail will be.
¶Neither will I with thée here remain,
Therefore dispatch and let vs away:
Think thou that I having nought for my payne,
Will either go with thée, or hear for thée stay▪
¶And what wilt thou ask, with me here to stay▪
At one word let me that understand.
¶At one word ten groats thou shalt pay,
Or else to the Counter we must out of hand▪
¶That will I doe with a right good will,
Rather then so much thou shalt get▪
I will not so much thy mind fulfil,
If that my heart, my hand may let.
¶Why then with speed let vs away,
This déede thou wilt repent I trow.
¶Well, wherefore now doe we stay,
I am ready hence to go.
¶Come on then.
¶Christianity I doe represent,
Muse not though the sword of policy I bear:
Neither marvel not what is mine intent,
That this fayleable shield of riches I wear.
Gréedy great, will have it so every where,
Gréedy great for this cause I have named,
For that the greater part use gréedines, which is to be blamed.
As the greater part will, thereto must I yéeld,
Their cruel force I may not withstand:
Therefore I bear this deformed sword and shield,
Which I may be ashamed to hold in my hand,
But the Lord deliver me from their thraldom and band,
For if the enemy assail me, then am I in thrall:
Because I lack such Armour, as is taught by S. Paule.
For in stead of Gods word, and the shield of faith,
I am deformed with policy, and riches vain:
And still I say, as the greater part says,
I am still a christian, and so shall remain,
My Christianity say they, no damage doth sustain:
But alas they are deceiuēd, their armour is not sure,
For neither policy, nor riches, may long time endure.
Yet upon those two, we greatly depend,
We say by policy, our selves we can save,
Riches as a shield, we say will defend,
And by riches we possess what ever we crave,
So that for riches, we sell all that we have.
Not only the body, and all things terrestrial,
But also the soul, which ought be celestial.
¶Alas I lament to hear the report,
Which of vs citizens in every place is spread:
It is not long since I came from the court,
Where I would have been glad to have hid my head.
With the spoil of the simple, there they say were fed,
So that for the covetous gréedines, which some citizens use,
A shameful ill report to the whole ensues.
But I must néedes confess some among vs there be,
For whose sakes the whole number bears great blame:
They abuse themselves so, towards every degrée,
As man without reason, and past wordly shame,
Neither regard they their own, nor their ill name.
So they may have the chassy treasure of the world,
They pass not both with God and man to be abhord.
There is no time nor place, that they will forbear,
When any of their help hath most néede:
Then shall he pay treble for his money or ware,
Or else of them he is not like to spéede.
They nothing regard his poverty or néede,
But who is it which yonder doth stand?
Holding the Sword of Policy in his hand,
Most certain I am, that face I should know,
Sir is not your name Christianity?
¶Yes undoubtedly, my name is so,
As you are faithful few imbraser of verity.
¶And shall the Sword of Policy, by Christianity be borne,
Truly that is contrary to your nature and kind:
Now are you deformed like a thing forlorn,
Which makes me suspect, of me in my mind.
¶Oh Faithful few, of me have no doubt,
I am Christianity, though thus deformed:
And though thus abused, by the great route,
Yet by God I trust, my title shall be turned.
¶By the power of God I will not delay,
To turn this title most untrue and feigned,
And I will endue thée, and that straight way,
With such weapons, as Saint Paule hath ordained.
¶Alas in vain this payne 〈◊〉 take,
For as you 〈…〉 few,
So the power is but small that you can make,
To resist the greedy great ones, who are against you.
¶Si Deus nobiscum, quis contranos,
If God be with vs, who may vs resist,
Weigh not then the number, but weigh his purpose,
Who rules all things, as himself doth lift.
I know how Gréedinesse, with the great part is used,
Their piling, poling, pinching and spoiling:
How both the simple and others, with them are abused,
They live by the fruits of other men's toiling.
But God is not dead, neither is he asleep,
Although for a time his hand he doth hold:
Yet doth he remember his little shéepe,
And will revenge the wrong done to his fold.
¶Let them say what they will, doe thou as I told thée,
Trust thou not to any knave of them all:
Not a Preacher of them all, in thy néede will uphold thée,
Try them who will, their devotion is small.
¶Thou wilt not beléeue how the Knave did prate,
Ye citizens repent, thus he did cry,
Look about in time quoth hée, or it be to late,
For the vengeance of God at hand is full ny.
As though he knew what were in Gods mind,
Surely it is a shame, they are so suffered to lye.
¶But in my talk great profit thou dost find,
They are all liars as their talk doth try,
By my doctrine thou haste great profit and gain,
Great riches and substance, thereby thou doest win:
To instruct thée daily I take great payne,
Which way thou shalt thy riches bring in.
¶Thou doest so in déede, and thanks I thee give,
But syrra, now I remember a thing:
Which made me not long since▪ to laugh in my sléeue,
To me a young Gentleman the Broker did bring,
Whose Father was dead of late as it séemed,
And his lands in Mortgage to a Merchant was laid,
Wherefore it behooved the same were redéemed,
For the day was at hand, when the same should be paid,
And I perceiving his néede to be such,
I thought I would pinch him or that I went,
To give mine own asking, he did not greatly grudge,
And when I had girded him, thence I him sent.
¶More shame for thée, and such as thou art,
That with life thou art permitted, it is great pity,
Thou art a Christian with a canckered heart,
And the cause of reproach to a whole city.
Christianity by thée is greatly abused,
Of his righteous Armour, thou doest him bereave,
And in stead thereof, by him to be used,
The Armour of Satan, with him thou dost leave.
¶Why would you not have me, how to invent,
Which way were best to bring in my gain?
¶But not in such sort, to set thine intent,
That all the world of thée should complain.
¶I cry you mercy, I know where you are now.
In a Courtiers behalf, this oration you make,
Of late there was one, complained how,
Excessive gain of him I did take.
It is the cast of them all so to say,
When prodigally their money is spent:
Or if the Prince will them not pay,
Then on the Merchant, some lies they invent.
¶Art thou not ashamed of thy Prince to speak ill?
Thine own abused doing to excuse:
No marvel though the city have all men's ill will,
When both in word and déede, thy self thou doest misvse.
Sed Reginum est male, audire cum besecerint,
Antisthenes doth truly this saying resit,
It is given to Princes (says he) though they be beneuolēt,
To be euell spoken of which is against all right.
¶Sir you are best say no more, then you are able to prove,
Least I make you to repent your boldness,
For if my patience you to much do move,
I may chance turn your heate into a coldness.
Why I lend my money like a friend for good will,
And thereby doe help men at their néede.
¶A friend thou art in déede, though a friend but ill,
Pithagoras thy friendship, hath plainly decréede,
There be many saith he, who no friends do lack,
And yet of friendship they have but scant,
So thou art a friend for their moneys sake,
And yet thy friendship they always shall want.
¶Assuredly thou highly offendest,
For that so double in dealing thou art:
Aristotle says, by the same thou pretend,
And not so to bear a dissembling heart.
A Christian ought not unto riches to yéeld,
For it is a thing but fayleable and vain,
Riches is no perpetual shield,
But the shield of Faith, shall ever remain▪
Take therefore faith, and Gods word for thy sword,
And arm Christianity in this wise.
¶Shall policy and riches then be abhord,
Sir they are fools that them will despise.
I put case poverty should me assail,
Can Gods word and faith me any thing aid:
Poverty against riches can never avail,
I am sure sir this may not be denayed.
¶We deny not, but in this world, riches bear the sway,
Yet, it not riches to be called sure:
For in Gods power it is to make riches decay,
Whereas Gods word and faith shall ever endure.
¶But give me riches, take you Gods word and faith,
And sée which of vs shall have the better gain.
¶Now Faithful few, you here what he saith,
Therefore to turn the tytles I must be fain,
¶Well since it will no better be,
To God let vs the cause betake:
Whom I trust, when as time he doth sée,
He will for vs, a deliverance make.
¶Come Master Wealthiness, let vs away,
What should we here any longer doe?
¶In déede I hold it best as you say,
Therefore your saying I agrée unto.
¶Sorry I am, to sée his estate,
Now near he is, to the Founte of perdition:
God grant him repentance, or it be to late,
That of his sins he may have remission.
¶But alas, he goes the contrary way,
For of his covetousness, he takes no rue•h▪
And Aristotle I remember doth say,
The covetous man cannot learn the truth.
Wherèfore he cannot, or will not know,
The way to reform me Christianity:
Therefore from this place now I will go,
To pray unto God, to show him the verity.
Now Faithful few adieu unto thée,
I will pray unto God for thy comfort and aid:
I beséech thée make like intercession for me,
And that my reformation be not long delayed.
¶Doubt not thereof good Christianity,
My endeavour herein shall not be delayed:
Alas what is man not knowing the verity,
No man, but a beast he may be said.
Yet many there are, which in the world doth live,
Who for Christians will néedes accounted be:
Though to all abominations, their selves they doe give,
And from no kind of vice be clear or frée▪
Covetousness is accounted no sin,
Usury is a science and art:
All ways are good, whereby we may win,
Although it be to our neighbours smart.
Whereby it appears, from love we are frée,
The words of the wise, we nothing regard:
For without love, no virtue can perfect bée,
As Plato the wise, hath plainly declared.
No good thing without love, it is possible to doe,
Seneca of that opinion hath been:
Then how many good things, do they now think you,
In whom no love at all there is séene.
They watch their times, the simple to snare,
No time they forbear, their pleasures to work:
God grant we therefore of them may beware,
For privily to snare vs, they daily doe lurk.
¶Oh more then wretch, which so foolishly haste spent,
Not only thine own goods, but also other men's:
What account shall I make, for the goods to me lent,
Which never I am able for to recompense.
How wistfully have I, with wantonness my wife,
Consumed our goods, substance and treasure,
That would to God I were out of my life,
For the remembrance thereof, is gréefe without measure.
My wife and I now, are asunder dispersed,
Each of vs, to séeke our living alone:
Alas our woe may not be rehearsed,
Unto whom now should we make our moan.
In taking the time, to toward we wear,
We were afraid to long to abide:
Corages council in mind we did bear,
He said that for no man would tarry the tide.
But well away now, which way shall I run,
I know it is folly unto God to call:
For God I know my petition will shun,
And into perdition I am now like to fall.
Despair, despair.
Why should I despair, since God doth behold,
The sinner with mercy as the Scripture doth say.
¶But thy prodigal sins are so manifold,
That God of mercy, doth thée utterly deny.
Therefore to end thy life it is best,
Thy calling for mercy, is all but in vain:
By ending thy life, thou shalt be at rest,
But if longer thou live, great shall be thy payne.
¶Well then will I seek some place where I may,
Finish my life with Cord, or with knife:
The dispatch thereof, I will not delay?
Farewell now all the world, but chéefely my wife.
¶Soft stay a while, and be not so rash,
Think thou God unmerciful to be:
Wilt thou trust despair, even at the first dash,
Hast thou no faith in Gods mercy so frée,
Call upon god with repentance and faith,
By such ways and means as I will instruct thée.
¶I beléeue God is merciful, as the Scripture says.
¶Well follow mée, and I will conduct thée.
Oh heavenly Father pardon my offence.
¶Oh heavenly father, pardon mine offence.
¶And grant that thy mercy may to me repair.
¶And grant that thy mercy may to me repair,
¶Also O Father banish thou hence.
¶Also O Father banish thou hence.
¶That wicked Monster of Despair,
¶That wicked Monster of Despair.
¶How féelest thou now, thy conscience and mind.
Hoyest thou not, of gods mercy and grace?
¶Well God be praised that here I thée find,
How happy was I to approach this place.
Despair is now fled, I perfectly know,
And in Gods mercy I firmly doe trust,
Therefore O Lord deliver me from thrall:
And pardon me a sinner, most vile and unjust.
¶That is very well said, if so thou doe think,
And now frame thy self, thy life to amend,
Let despair no more into thy mind sink:
But to be a new man, doe thou now pretend.
And as hertofore thy mind for to please,
Thou haste learned the Tide will tarry no man,
So now it behooves for thy greater ease,
That saying, after Gods will for to scan.
Take time while time is, thus I doe mean,
Amend thy life whilst here thou haste space:
To Gods merciful promises sée that thou lean,
So shalt thou enjoy the Tide of his grace.
¶To follow your council, I will doe my endeavour,
I will séeke the same in all points to perform:
The effect of your words I will forget never,
And now I will hence, my wife to reform.
That she and I, in manner now,
May amend our lives, to Gods glory and praise:
Wherefore good sir unto you adieu,
I beséech the Lord to send thée good days.
¶Sée how the time takers their fact doth repent,
Who no time will spare in pleasing their will:
And although the beginning have a pleasant sent,
Yet of the ending, the taste is as ill.
For who ever it be that without measure,
Doth consume his substance in prodigal sort:
Although he had abundance of treasure,
Yet will he be a beggar, and that in time short.
I marvel where Authority is,
Who should sée a help for the simple oppressed:
Many things there are greatly amiss,
Which by his means must néedes be redressed.
His absence greatly disquieted my mind,
I will not cease séeking, until him I do find.
¶Out alas this tidings are ill,
My friend master Gréedinesse, hath ended his days,
Despair upon him hath wrought his will,
And desperately now he is gone his ways.
As one enraged and out of his wit,
No remembraun•e of God he would have:
Alas pore man he had a great fit,
Before that well he was laid in his grave.
Why but is Gréedines dead in good sadness,
My thinks these news are not true which you tell:
Yes truly he dyed in a great madness,
And went with the Tide boat straight into hell.
Why fool, Gréedinesse will never dye,
So long as covetous people do live:
Then you belike doe think that I doe lye,
I am as honest a man as any in your sléeue.
I am sure he is dead, or one in his likeness,
For when he was buried I stood by:
And some said he dyed of the new sickness,
Therefore sir think not that I doe lye.
For I am as sorry for the death of the man,
As any man that lives this day:
Wherefore I must néedes wéepe if I can.
But hushed some body is coming this way.
¶Surely Authority the same is even he,
I warrant you sir, you néede not to doubt.
¶Then will we handle him kindly thou shalt sée.
Therefore sée that from vs hée escape not out.
¶God save your honour, and prosper your estate,
I am glad to sée you approach this place:
Those which say ill of you, I utterly doe hate,
I answer for your honour in every case.
¶Ah crafty caitiff, why dissemble thou so?
Doest thou think that vs thou may so blind,
Thy contagious doings we right well do know,
And eake thy property, nature and kind.
Thou art an encorager to all kinds of vice,
The Aged to avarice, and greedy desire,
The younger sort lack none of thine advice,
To all such acts as the Devil doth require.
¶Lo Sir, I thought you did me mistake,
I know right well, the man whom you mean,
To fetch him heather, good spéede I will make,
I warrant you, I will shortly be here again.
¶Nay soft he is here, whom that we would have,
Therefore you néede not him for to fetch.
¶Yes I will fetch him, for he is a very knave,
And alms it is, that a rope he should stretch.
¶Upon thy self, just judgment thou doest give,
Juvenal says, Cities are well governed,
Whereas such rebels are now suffered to live,
But after their deserts, are justly punished.
¶They which are Rebels, it behooves in déede,
That they be corrected and punished so,
For they doe much harm in every stéede,
But I am none such, I would you should know.
¶Thou shalt know what thou art, or hence we depart,
Faithful few upon him lay hold.
¶By gis sir, then I will cause him to smart,
Therefore to touch me, be not so bold.
¶Sir sée where comes Correction also.
¶Draw near Correction and thine office doe,
Take here this caitiff unto the Jail.
¶Sir to doe your commandment I will not fail,
Come on Syrra and let vs away.
¶Nay soft a while your wisdom stay.
Hold me when you have me, but you have me not yet,
And perchance ere you have me, your nose I will slit.
¶Thinkeit thou with brags to make me afraid.
¶You are best stand further, least I shave your beard.
¶In faith sir, now I will give you the check, &amp; catches him
¶Oh gods passion, wilt thou break my neck?
Is there no man here that hath a cursed wife,
If he will in my stead, he shall end his life.
¶Tush let vs hence, thy talk is in vain.
¶Sithēns there is no remedy, best is a short payne.
¶When all malefactors are duly thus punished,
According to the good and godly laws,
Then shall Christianity duly be burnished,
And to praise God, we shall have cause.
¶O Faithful few, doubt not but as we,
Are able Christianities estate to reform:
So his reformation in short time thou shall sée,
For we for his estate doe lament and morn.
Of our selves we are not able to compass this thing,
But by this sword of Gods power, which to vs is 〈◊〉:
Wherefore Faithful few, have thou no doubting,
But we thereunto doe gladly consent.
For to Socrates saying, some respect we have,
W•o says a city is not to be praised,
For he greatness or buildings, gorgeous and brave,
But for the good inhabitants, which therein are placed.
So we account those countries but ill,
Which vicious persons doth maintain and norish,
Although they have all things at their will,
And although in treasure they abundantly flourish.
¶Oh noble Authority, by this your occasion,
Great tranquillity to vs shall befall:
We shall be a joy to each godly nation,
When Christianity is delivered from thrall.
For better it were unchristened to be,
Then our Christianity for to abuse:
The Jewish Infidel to God doth more agrée,
Then such as Christianity do so misuse.
But sée yonder where he doth appear,
Whom abused armour doth greatly oppress.
¶O Christianity unto vs draw near,
That we thy abused estate may redress.
And as fréely as this power unto vs is lent,
Here we now by force of the same:
To thée faytfull few do here condescend,
That thou Christianities estate shalt frame.
In such good form, fashion, and shape,
As the same shall not be turned again:
But shall continue in a Godly rate,
From henceforth evermore to remain.
¶God grant that so it may be kept,
As all Christians it may become:
And for my part i• shall not be slept,
But my duty shall straight way be done.
¶Now God be praised who thus again,
Hath restored me to my former estate:
And hath extinguished from me all payne,
God grant that now 〈◊〉 not found vngrate.
And God grant that all Christians may me duly embrace,
In such sort as Gods will it is:
So shall they be sure of a resting place,
In Heaven where reigns all joy and bliss.
