DEus hic / the holy trynyte
Preserve all / that now here be
Dere bretherne / if ye will consider
The cause why / I am come hyder
Ye would be glad / to know my intent
For I com not hither / for money nor for rent
I com not hither / for meat nor for meal
But I com hither / for your souls heal
I com not hither / to poll nor to shave
I com not hither to beg nor to crave
I com not hither / to gloss nor to flatter
I com not hither to babble nor to clatter
I com not hither / to fable nor to lye
But I come hither / your souls to edify
For we freres / are bound the people to tech
The gospel of Christ / openly to preach
As did the oppose•else / by Christ their master sent
To turn the people / and make them to repent
But sith the appostels / fro heaven would not come
We freres now / must occupy their rome
We freres are bound / to search men conscience
We may not care for grotes / nor for pens
We freres have professed / wilful poverty
No penny in our purse / have may we
Knife nor staff / may we none cary
Except we should / from the gospel vary
For worldly aduersyte / may we be in no sorrow
We may not care to day / for our meat to morrow
Bare foot and bare legged / must we go also
We may not care / for frost nor snow
We may have / no manner care no think
Another for our meat / nor for our drink
But let our thoughts / fro lush things be as free
As be the birds / that in the ayre flee
For why our lord / clyped sweet Iesus
In the gospel / speaks to vs thus
Through all the world / go ye saith he
And to every creature / speak ye of me
And show of my doctrine / and conning
And that they may / be glad of your coming
If that you enter / in any house any where
Loke that ye salute them / and bid my peas be there
And if that house / be worthy and elect
Thylke peace there / than shall take effect
And if that house / be cursyd or pervert
Thylke peace than shall to your self revert
And furthermore / if any such there be
Which do deny / for to receive ye
And do despise / your doctrine and your lore
At such a house / tarry ye no more
And from your shoes / scrape away the dust
To their reprefe / and I both true and just
Shall vengeance take / of their sinful dede
¶Wherefore my friends / to this text take ye heed
Beware how ye / despise the pore freres
Which are in this world / crystes ministers
But do them with an hearty chere receive
Lest they happen / your houses for to leave
And than god will take vengeance in his ire
Wherefore I now / that am a pore frere
Did enquere / were any people were
Which were dysposyd / the word of god to here
And as I cam hither / one did me tell
That in this town / right good folk did dwell
Which to here the word of god would be glad
And as soon as I / thereof knolege had
I hyder hied me as fast as I might
Entendyd by the grace of god almyght
And by your pacyens / and supportacyon
Here to make / a simple collation
Wherefore I require all ye in this prese
For to abide / and give dew audience
¶But first of all
Now here I shall
To god my prayer make
To give ye grace
All in this place
His doctrine for to take.
¶ And than kneeled down the frere saying his pray∣ers / and in the mean while entered the pardoner with all •is rely•ues / to declare what eche of them ben / and the hole power and virtue thereof.
¶God and saint Leonarde send ye all his grace
As many as ben assembled in this place
¶ 〈◊〉 devout people / that here do assemble
I pray good / that ye may all well resemble
The image / after which you are wrought
And that ye save / that Christ in you bought
¶Devout Christen people / ye shall all wit
That I am come hither / ye to visit
Wherefore let vs pray / thus or I begin
Our saviour preserve ye / all from sin
And enable ye to receive / this blessed pardon
Which is the greatest / under the son
Granted by the pope / in his bulls under led
Which pardon ye shall find / when ye are dede
That offered / other gro•es or else pens
To these holy relics / which or I go hens
I shall here show / in open audience
Exortynge ye all / to do to them reverence
¶ But first ye shall• know well / yt I com fro Rome
•o here my bulls / al• and some
Our liege lord seal / here on my patent
I bear with me / my body to warrant
That no man be so by•de / be he priest or clarke
Me to disturb / of Chrystes holy work
Nor have no dysdayne / nor yet scorn
Of these holy relics / which saints have worn
¶First here I show ye / of a holy Jaws sheep
A bone / I pray you take good keep
To my words / and mark them well
If any of your bestes belyes do swell
Dyppe this bone in the water / that he doth take
Into his body / and the swellynge shall s•ache
And if any worm / have •our beestes story
Take of this water / and wasshe his tongue
And it will be hole anon / and furthermore
Of pockes and scabs / and every sore
He shall be quyte hole / that drinks of the well
That this bone is dipped in / it is treuth that I tell
And if any man that any best owes
Ones in the weke / or that the cock crows
Fasting will drink / of this well a draught
As that holy Jew hath vs taught
His beestes and his store / shall multiply
And masters all / it helps well
Though a man be foul / in jealous rage
Let a man with this water / make his pottage
And neuermore shall he / his wife mystryst
Though he in sothe the faut by her wit
Or had she be take with freres two or three
¶Here is a mitten eke / as ye may se
He that his hand will put in this mitten
He shall have / increase of his grayn
That he has sown / be it wet or ••is
So that he offer pens / or else grotes
And another holy relyke / eke here se ye may
The blessed a•me / of sweet saint sunday
And who so ever is blessyd / with this right hand
Can not speed amiss / by se nor by land
And if he offered / eke with good devotion
He shall not fail / to come to high promocyon
¶And another holy relyke here may ye see
The great too / of the holy trynyte
And who so ever ones doth it in his mouth take
Be shall never be dysseasyd / with the tothe ache
Canker nor pockys shall there none breed
This that I show ye / is matter in dede
¶And here is of our lady / a relyke full good
Her bongrace / which she ware with her french hod
When she went out / always for son bornynge
Women with child / which be in mourning
By virtue thereof / shall be soon easyd
And of their travail / full soon also releasyd
And if this bongrace / they do devoutly kiss
And offer thereto / as their devotion is
¶Here is another relyke / eke a precious one
Hf all helowes / the blessyd Iaw bone
Which relyke / without any fail
Against poison / chefely doth prevail
For whom so ever it touches / without dout
All manner venom / from him shall issue out
So that it shall hurt / no manner wight
Lo of this relyke / the great power and might
Which preseruyth from poison every man
Lo of saint Myghell / eke the brain pan
Which for the head ache / is a preseruatyfe
To every man or best / that beryth life
And further it shall stand him in better stead
For his heed shall never ache when that he is dede
Nor he shall feel / no manner grefe nor pain
Though with a sword / one cleue it than a twain
But be as one that lay in a dede sleep
Wherefore to these relykes / now com crouch and crepe
But loke that ye offering to them make
Or else can ye no manner profit take
But one thing ye women all I warrant you
If any wight / be in this place now
That has done syn / so horrible that she
Dare not for shame / thereof sheyuen be
Or any woman / be she young or old
That has made her husband cockolde
Such folk shall have / no power nor no grace
To offer to my relykes / in this place
And who so fyndyth / her self out of such blame
Com hither to me on crystes holy name
¶And because ye
Shall unto me
G•ue credence at the full
Mine auctoryte
Now shall ye se
Lo here the popes bull
¶Now shall the frere begin his sermon / and euyn at the same time the pardoner begins also to show and speak of his bullies / and auctorytes com from Rome.
¶Date et dabitur vobis
¶Good devout people / this place of scripture
¶Worshipful masters / ye shall understand
Is to you / that have no literature
¶That pope Leo the .x. hath granted with his hand
Is to say / in our english tongue
¶And by his bulls / confirmed under led
As depart your goods / the poor folk among
¶To all manner people / both quick and dede
And god shall than / give unto you again
¶Ten thousand years / &amp; as many •entes of pardon
This in the gospel / so is written plain
¶When they are dede / their souls for to guerdon
Therefore give your alms / in the largest wise
¶That will with their penny / or alms dede
Keep not your goods / fie fie on couetyse
¶Put to their hands / to the good speed
That sin with god is most abominable
¶Of the holy chapel of sweet saint Leonarde
And is eke the sin / that is most damnable
¶Which late by fire / was destroyed and mart
In scripture eke / but I say sirs how
¶Ay by the mas / one can not here
What a babbling makes yonder fellow
¶For the babbling / of yonder foolish frere
In scripture eke / is there many a place
¶And also masters / as I was about to tell
Which shows that many a mā so farforth lacks grace
¶Pope July ye .vi. hath graūted fair &amp; well
That when to them / god has abundance sent
¶And doth .xii. thousand years of pardon to thē send
They wo•de distribute none to the indigent
¶That ought / to this holy chapel lend
Whereat god having / great indignation
¶Pope Bonyface / the .ix. also
Punished these men / after a divers fashion
¶Pope July / pope Innocent / with divers popes mo
As the gospel / full nobly doth declare
¶Has granted / to the sustaining of the same
How dives Epulus / reigning in welfare
¶v. thousand years of pardō / to every of you by name
And on his board / dishes delicate
¶And clean remission / also of their syn
Pore Lazarus / cam begging at his gate
¶As often times / as you put in
Desiring some foot / his honger to relive
¶Any money / into the pardoners cofer
But the rycheman / nothing would him give
¶Or any money up unto it offer
Not so much as a few crommys of bread
¶Or he that offeryth / penny or groat
Wherefore pore lazarus / of famine strayth was dede
¶Or he that gives / the pardoner a new cote
And angels his soul / to heaven did cary
¶Or take of me / out•er image or letter
But now the rich man / of the contrary
¶Whereby this pore chapel may / fair the better
When he was dede / went to misery and payne
¶And god wot / it is a full gracious dede
Where for evermore / he shall remain
¶For which god / shall quyte you well your mede
In brennyng fire / which shall never cease
¶Now help our pore chapel / if it be your will
But I say thou pardoner / I bid the hold thy peace
¶And I say thou frere / hold thy tongue styll
What stand thou there / all the day smattering
¶Mary what standyst thou there / all day clattering
¶Mary fellow I com hyder / to preach the word of god
Which of no man / may be forbode
But harde with silence / and good intent
For why / it teaches them evident
The very way / and path that shall them led
Even to heaven gatys / as straight as any thread
And he that lettyth the word / of god of audience
Stands accursed / in the great sentence
And so art thou / for interrupting me
¶Nay thou art a cursed / knave / and that shalt thou se
And all such that to me / make interruption
The pope sends them / excommunycacyon
By his bullies / here ready to be red
By bysshoppes / and his cardinals confirmed
And eke if thou / disturb me any thing
Thou art also / a traitor to the king
For here hath he granted me / under his broad seal
That no man / if he love his heal
Should me disturb / or let in any wise
And if thou dost / the kings commandment despise
I shall make the be set / fast by the fete
And where thou saydyst / that thou art more mete
Among the people / here for to preach
Because thou dost them / the very way tech
•ow to com / to heaven aboue
Therein thou lie / and that shall I prove
And by good reason / I shall make the bow
And know that I / am met•r than art thou
¶For thou / when thou hast taught them ones the way
Thou e•rest not / wheth•r they com there ye or nay
But when that thou / hast done all together
And taught them the way / for to com thither
Yet all that thou can imagine
Is but to use virtue / and to abstain fro syn
And if they fall ones / than thou can no more
Thou can not give them / a salve for their sore
But these my letters / be clean purgation
All though never so many sins / they have don
But when thou hast taught them the way and all
Yet or they com there / they may have many a fall
In the way / or that they com thither
For why the way / to heaven is very slitter
But I will tech them after another race
For I shall bring them to heaven gate
And be their gydes / and conduct all things
And led them thither / by the purse strings
So that they shall not fall / though that they would
¶Hold thy peace knave / thou art very bold
Thou prate in faith / even like a pardoner
¶Why despysest thou / the popes minister
Masters / here I curse him openly
And therewith warn / all this hole company
By the popes / great auctoryte
That ye leave him / and hearken unto me
For till h• be assoyled / his words take none effect
For out of holy church / he is now clean reject
¶My masters / he doth but gest and rave
It forseth not / for the words of a knave
But to the word of god do reverence
And here me forth / with dew audience
¶Masters I swewed you / ere while of alms dede
¶Masters this pardon / which I showed you before
And how ye should give poor folk at their need
Is the greatest that ever was / sith god was bore
And if of your parts / that thing ones were don
For why without confession or contrycyon
Dout not but god should give you retribution
¶By this shall ye have / clean remission
But now further / it ought to be declared
¶And forgiven of the sins se••n
Who be these pore folk that should have your reward
¶Come to this pardon / if ye will come to heaven
Who be those pore folk / of whom I speak &amp; name
¶Come to this pardon if ye will be in bliss
Certes we pore freres / are the same
¶This is the pardon / which ye can not miss
We freres daily take pain I say
¶This is the pardon which shall men's souls wyn
We friars daily / do both fast and pray
¶This is the pardon / the rydder of your sin
We freres travail / and labour every hour
¶This is the pardon / that purchases all grace
We freres take payne / for the love of our saviour
This is a pardon for all manner of trespass
We freres also go on lymytacyon
¶This is ye pardō / of which all mercy doth spring
For to preach / to every christen nation
¶This is the pardon that to heaven shall ye bring
But I say thou pardoner / thou will keep silence (soon)
¶Ye it is like to be when I have done
Mary therefore the more knave art thou I say
That parturbest / the word of god I say
〈◊〉 neither thy self / will here goddess doctrine
〈◊〉 suffer other / their earys to incline
•herfore our saviour in his holy scripture
Clyueth the thy iugement / thou cursyd creature
Speaking to the / after this manner
Maledictus queen audit verbum dei negligenter
Wo be that man saith our lord / that gives no adieu•
Or heryth the word / of god with negligence
¶Now thou haste spoken all sir daw
I care not for the / an old straw
I had lever thou were hanged / up with a rope
Than I that am come from the pope
And thereby gods minister / while thou stādest &amp; prate
Should be fain to knock without the gate
Therefore preach hardly / thy belly full
But I nevertheless / will declare the popes bull
¶Now my friends / I have before showed ye
¶Now my masters / as I have before declared
That good it is to give your charity
¶That pardoners from you may not be spared
And further I have / at length to you told
¶Now here after / shall follow and ensew
Who be these people / that ye receive should
¶That followed of pardons / the great vertew
That is to say / vs freres pore
¶We pardoners for your souls be as necessary
That for our living must beg fro door to door
As is the meat / for our bodies hungry
For of our own propre / we have no propre thing
For pardons is the thing that brings men to heaven
But that we get / of devout peoples getting
¶Pardons delyuereth them fro the sins seven
And in our place / be fryers three score and three
¶Pardons for every crime / may dispense
Which only live / on men's charity
Pardon purchasyth grace for all offence
For we friars / wilful charity profess
¶Ye though ye had slain / both father and mouth•
We may have no money / another more nor less
¶And this pardon / is chief aboue all other
For wordly treasure we may nought care
¶For who to it offeryth / groat or penny
Our souls must be rich / and our bodies bare
¶Though sins / he had done never so many
And one thing I had almost left behind
¶And though that he had all his kindred slain
Which before / cam not to my mind
¶This pardon shall rid thē fro ever lasting payne
And doubtless it is none other thing
¶There is no syn / so abominable
But when ye will give / your alms &amp; offering
¶Which to remit / this pardon is not able
Loke that ye / distribute it wisely
¶As well declares / the sentence of this letter
Not to every man / that for it will cry
¶Ye can not therefore / bestow your money bett•
For if ye give / your alms in that wise
¶Let vs not here / stand idle all the day
It shall not both to them and vs suffice
¶Give vs some money / or that we go our way
But I say / thou lewd fellow thou
Hottest none other time to show thy bulls but now
Can not tarry and abide till soon
And rede them than when preaching is done
¶I will rede them now / what say thou thereto
Hast thou any thing therewith to do
Think that I will stand / &amp; tarry for thy leisure
Am I bound to do so much for thy pleasure
For my pleasure? nay I would thou knewyst it well
It becomes the knave / never a dell
To prate thus boldly in my presence
And let the word / of god of audience
¶Let the word of god quoth a? nay let a horsō dreuyll
Prate here all day / with a foul evil
And all thy sermon / goth on couetyce
And bid men beware of avarice
And yet in thy sermon / dost thou none other thing
But for alms stand all the day begging
Leave thy reeling I would the advise
¶Nay leave thou thy babbling / if thou be wise
I would thou knew it knave / I will not leave a (whyt)
¶No more will I / I do the well to wit
It is not thou / shall make me hold my peas
Thā speak on hardly if thou thynkyst it for thy 〈◊〉
For I will speak / whither thou will or no
¶In faith I care not / for I will speak also
Wherefore hardly / let vs both go to
Se which shall be better harde of vs two
What should ye give ought to prating pardoners
¶What should ye spend on these flattering liars
What should ye give ought to these bold beggars
¶As be these babbling monks / and these freres
Let them hardly labour for their living
¶Which do nought daily / but babble and lye
It much hurtyth them / good mennys giving
¶And tell you fables dere enough a fly
For that makes them idle / and slothful to work
¶As doth this babbling frere / here to day
That for none other thing they will cark
¶〈1 line〉
Hardly they would go both to plow &amp; carry
¶On vs pardoners hardly do your cost
And if of necessity ones they felt the smart
¶For why / your money never can be lost
But we freres be not in like estate
¶For why / there is in our fraternity
For our hands with such things we may not macu (late)
¶For all brethren &amp; sisteren that thereof be
We freres be not in like condition
¶Devoutly songe every year
we may have no prebendes no exhibition
¶As he shall know well that comes there
Of all temporal service are we forbode
¶At every of the five solemn festes
And only bound to the service of god
¶A mass &amp; dirige to pray for the good rest
And therewith to pray for every christen nation
¶Of the souls of the brethren &amp; sisteren all
That god witsafe to save them fro dampnation
¶Of our fraternity in general
But some of you so harde be of heart
¶with a hearse there standing / well arrayed &amp; dyght
Ye can not weep though ye full sore smart
And torches &amp; tapers about it brennynge bright
wherefore some man must ye hire needs
¶And with the belles eke solemnly ringing
which must entreat god for your misdedes
¶And prestos &amp; clerks devoutly singing
Ye can hire no better in mine opinion
¶And furthermore / every night in the year
Than vs gods servants / men of religion
¶Twelve pore people are received there
And specially god hears vs pore freres
¶And there have both harborow and food
And is attentife unto our desires.
¶That for them is convenient and good
For the more of religion / the more herd of our lord
¶And furthermore / if there be any other
And that is / so should / good reason doth accord
¶That of our fraternity be sister or brother
Therefore dout not masters / I am even he
¶〈…〉 after hap to fall in decay
To whom ye should part with your charity
¶And if he than chance to come that way
we freres be they that should your alms take
¶Nigh unto our foresaid holy place
which for your souls he•th do both watch &amp; wake
¶Ye shall there tarry for amon these space
we freres pray / god wot when ye do sleep
¶And be there found of the places cost
we for your sins do both sob and weep
¶wherefore now in the name of the holy goosed
To pray to god for mercy and for grace
¶I advise you all that now here be
And thus do we daily with all our hole place
¶For to be of our fraternity
wherefore distribute of your temporal welthe
¶Fie on covets / stick not for a penny
By which ye may preserve your souls helthe
¶For which ye may have benefits so many
I say will thou not yet stint thy clap
Pu•l me down the pardoner with an evil hap
¶Moister frere / I hold it best
To keep your tongue while ye be in rest
I say one pull the knave of his stole
¶Nay one pull the frere down like a foal
Leave thy railing and babbelynge of freres
Or by Eyes Each lug the by the sweet ears
¶By god I would thou durst presume to it
By god a little thing might make me to do it
¶And I shrew thy heart and thou spare
By god I will not miss the much thou slouch
And if thou play me such another touche
Each knock the on the costarde / I would thou it knew
¶Mary that would I se quote blind hew
Well I will begin / and than let me se
whether thou dare again interrupt me
And what thou would ones to it say
¶Begin &amp; prove whether I will ye or nay
And to go forth where as I left right now
¶Because some percase will think amiss of me
Our lord in the gospel shows the way how
¶Ye shall now here / the poppies auctoryte
¶By gogges soul knave / I suffer the no longer
I say some good body / lend me his hengar
And I shall him tech by god almyght
How he shall a another time learn for to fight
I shall make that bald crown of his to loke rede
I shall leave him but one ere / on his heed
But I shall leave the never an ere or I go
¶Ye horizon frere / will thou so
¶Than the fight.
¶Lose thy hands / away from mine earys
Than take thou thy hands away from my here is
Nay abide thou whore•son I am not down yet
I trust first to lye the at my fete
Ye horizon / will thou scrat and byte
Ye mary will I / as lunge as thou dost smite
¶The curate.
¶Hold your hands / a vengeance on ye both two
That ever ye came hither / to make this a do
To polute my church / a mischief on you light
I swear to you by god all might
Ye shall both repent / every vain of your heart
As sore as ye did / ever thing or ye depart
¶Master parson / I marvel ye will give license
To this false knave / in this audience
To publish his ragman rolls with lies
I desired him iwis / more than ones or twice
To hold his peas / till that I had done
•ut he would here no more than the man in the moan
¶Why should I suffer the / more than thou me
Master parson gave me license before the
And I would thou knewyst it / I have relykes here
Other manner stuff / than thou dost bear
I will edify more / with the sight of it
Than will all the prating of holy wryt
For that except that the preacher / him self live well
His predycacyon will help never a dell
And I know well / that thy living is nought
Thou art an apostate / if it were well sought
An homicide thou art I know well enough
For my self knew where thou sloughe
A wench with thy dagger in a couch
And yet as thou say in thy sermō yt no mā shall touch
No more of this wrangling in my chiyrch
I shrew your hartys both / for this l••rche
Is there any blood shed here between these knaves
Thanked be god / they had no stays
Nor egoteles / for than it had ben wrong
Well ye shall singe another songe
Neybour prat / com hither I you pray
¶Why / what is this nyse fray
¶I can not tell you / one knave dysdaynes another
Wherefore take ye the tone / and I shall take the other
We shall bestow them / there as is most convenient
For such a couple / I trow they shall repent
That ever they met in this church here
Neyboure ye be constable / stand ye ne'er
Take ye that lay knave / and let me alone
With this gentleman / by god and by saint Iohn̄
I shall borrow upon prestholde somewhat
For I may say to the neybour prat
It is a good dede to punish such to the ensample
Of such other / how that they shall mell
In like fashion as these catyfes do
¶In good faith master parson / if ye do so
Ye do but well / to tech them to beware
¶Master prat I pray ye me to spare
For I am sorry / for that that is done
Wherefore I pray ye forgive me soon
For that I have offendyd within your liberty
And by my truth sir / ye may trust me
I will never come hither more
while I live and god before
¶Nay I am ones charged with the
Wherefore by saint Iohn̄ thou shalt not escape me
Till thou hast scouryd a pare of stokys
¶Tut he weans all is but mocks
Lay hand on him / and com ye on sir frere
Ye shall of me hardly have your hire
Ye had none such this .vii. year
I swear by god / and by our lady dere
¶Nay master parson / for goddess passion
Entreat not me after that fashion
For if ye do it will not be for your honesty
Honesty or not / but thou shall se
What I shall do by and by
Make no stroglynge / com forth soberly
For it shall not avail the I say
¶Mary that shall we try / even strayt way

We shall se first which is the stronger

Neybour prat bring forth that knave
And thou sir frere if thou will algatys rave
¶Nay chorle I the defy
I shall trouble the first
Thou shalt go to prison by and by
Let me se now do thy worst
¶Help help neybour prat neybour prat
In the worship of god / help me somewhat
¶Nay deal as thou can with that elf
For why I have enough to do my self
Alas for pain I am almost dede
The reed blood so ronneth down about my heed
Nay and thou can I pray the help me
Nay by the mas fellow it will not be
I have more tow on my distaff / thā I can well spyn
The cursed frere doth the upper hand wyn
Will ye leave than / and let vs in peace depart
¶Ye by our lady / even with all our heart
¶Than adieu to the devil till we come again
¶And a mischief go with you both twain.
